I think this is a great place for very technical discussion and Q&amp;A and thus would like this to be a place where people can ask and answer questions about software applications typically used in digital preservation work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We should try and avoid shopping list questions, however, I think it is completely relevant to ask for advice on which particular tools do a good job addressing particular preservation risks or threats. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, when it comes to digital preservation software applications (JOVE, Fedora, DSpace, Archivematica, etc) or content management systems that are used as defacto digital preservation systems (ex. ContentDM, Omeka, etc) I think it is relevant to ask those questions here. Granted, there will be questions that are so detailed with these applications that the would be better fielded on application specific support-email lists. In my mind, the litmus test should be if the questions and answers would be useful things for folks working in digital preservation to potentially know about or be aware of. " />

Furthermore – if you work through a problem &quot;offline&quot; with one of your colleagues, and you think that it is a question that is not too specific and will be useful to the community, post the original question here, and have your colleague answer the question.

I regret having to say this, but based on the current Q&amp;A and activity levels it doesn't look like this site is going to make it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why? Well, we see a couple of primary issues here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**The turnout and the activity are very low.** Only 24% of the folks who committed to this proposal actually joined the site. Only about a fifth of those people are actually posting questions and answers. When we look at meta, that number gets even lower. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Stack Exchange site cannot thrive unless there's a dedicated and passionate community behind it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**There doesn't seem to be a clear direction for the site's scope** and there is a fair amount of disagreement within the community here on what actually belongs on the site. Out of the 79 questions currently posted, only 57 are still open. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Normally scope issues could be something worked out during beta. However, the purpose of the private beta is to set up a site that's ready to welcome users from the general public and has worked out all but a few minor issues. The concerns here, unfortunately, are more fundamental than that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Judging by the meta discussions and the example questions on the Area 51 proposal, it seems fairly clear that this proposal was backed by several distinct groups of people, and &quot;digital preservation&quot; means something different to all of them. To some, it means asset management within a company. To others, it's about preserving legacy software. To others still, it is about manipulating file formats. The end result is that none of these groups is served well by the site we have now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have sites that may welcome the different factions of Digital Preservation. For example, general questions about file formats could likely land on [Super User](http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/file-format), while issues of long-term preservation of content would not be out of place on [Libraries and Information Science](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/tags/digital-preservation/info). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That doesn't mean that there cannot or should not be a separate site handling these topics, but unfortunately, as it stands, *this site isn't it*. Barring any act-of-god scenarios, the site will be closed on March 18th and the data archived for download. That should give you sufficient time to save your favorite posts and discuss ideas about how to move forward.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This doesn't have to be the end. If you still believe this subject can work, feel free to try again through Area 51. We simply have to explore the harder questions of what this site is about, and to figure out how to regain (and retain!) all the support lost from the original proposal. If the support is there, your efforts should go quickly the second time around. If not, perhaps it wasn’t meant to be. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck!" />

In raw numbers, that's right around 90 people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Only about a fifth of those people are actually posting questions and answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I take it you mean about 20% of the people who committed. So 75 people are actually active on the site. That's close to 85% of the people who actually did join, which doesn't sound too bad to me. Certainly there are more than 20-ish people who have posted questions or answers here.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When we look at meta, that number gets even lower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Isn't that a common theme, though? Especially given that if someone has already stated what amounts to your opinion, an upvote on the question and/or answer expresses that?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Out of the 79 questions currently posted, only 57 are still open.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;75 people have posted 79 questions in two weeks, and of those, 57 are still open. That's about 0.4 still open questions per active participant per week (or about 0.5 questions asked per active participant per week). I certainly don't ask one question every two weeks on StackOverflow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**It seems to me like a two week private beta period is much too short** from which to draw any firm conclusions about the site's long-term viability. Right around three weeks from when I received the private beta invitation email and the announced closure date.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Judging by the meta discussions and the example questions on the Area 51 proposal, it seems fairly clear that this proposal was backed by several distinct groups of people, and &quot;digital preservation&quot; means something different to all of them. To some, it means asset management within a company. To others, it's about preserving legacy software. To others still, it is about manipulating file formats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only real guidance thus far is the FAQ (and those very meta discussions). The FAQ simply says that &quot;Digital Preservation - Stack Exchange is for `professionals working to ensure long term access to digital objects`.&quot; I'd argue that the examples you list all pretty much fall into that category, given appropriate form. You can't find something efficiently without some form of asset management in place, and an unsearchable archive is effectively useless. Preserving legacy software may be an inherent part of the ability to ensure that information is useful, not just accessible as bits of data, in the future. Discussions about file formats fall well into that, too; if you're going to migrate data to another file format for long-term preservation, you don't want to have to re-do that work in five or ten years if you can avoid it, *particularly* if the conversion is *potentially* lossy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, one could always argue that asset management is equally applicable to libraries regardless of the type of asset in question (and thus a &quot;better&quot; fit for LIS), that questions about various file formats is a general computer question (making it a &quot;better&quot; fit for e.g. SuperUser) and so on. But that assumes that there are no DP-specific issues at hand because, frankly, how many digital preservation experts hang out on SuperUser on the off chance that someone asks about the [century-long prospects of various image file formats](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/q/32/97) or [long term storage of disk images](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/q/151/97)? (Shameless plug; taking two examples of questions I have answered and which are still open on DP.SE.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I do believe this site deserves more than two weeks of private beta before being declared non-viable.** Maybe it'll turn out that it indeed isn't viable as-is, or that the scope is too broad. But it seems much too early to make such a firm statement. If the site needs more work before going public beta, I'd argue that a longer private beta period to actually hash out those issues is a better alternative than killing it outright." />

If there's a statistical threshhold beneath which proposed sites are considered not viable, I understand, but the quality of discussion here was IMO quite high and worth reflecting on. (Disclaimer: I'm a StackExchange noob, so I don't know if similar issues have been discussed in the context of other stacks.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even during its short lifespan, I learned a great deal from this stack, and I agree with Ben's objection to the description of differing views as &quot;factions.&quot; Given time, I think that we could have developed a clear and reasonable definition of the site's scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital preservation is an emerging field that overlaps with a number of different disciplines and skill sets. Different practitioners understand the field differently -- but it's very helpful to be able discuss and apply these understandings *in the context of practice*. This is an opportunity to move the field forward and (perhaps) resolve some of those differences. Direct engagement with other practitioners' day-to-day problems helps reveal and clarify the underlying assumptions of our shared discipline.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the title of a recent symposium put it, there's a &quot;[Digital Curation Gap][1]&quot; between researchers at large institutions and the on-the-ground practice of working LAM professionals. I'm an archivist in a small repository with limited resources. Although I try to keep up with the professional literature, I'm not directly involved with any major academic or governmental research projects. I found participation in the stack useful both in sharpening my own understanding and in confirming the correctness of my practice by helping to solve other people's problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize that Stack Exchange isn't the best forum for thornier questions of professional identity, but I do think that (as Ross and other commenters have alluded to) this stack had the potential to provide a service beyond simply being a problem-solving resource. I'm not aware of any other spaces in which this sort of informed but practical discussion is taking place. (If there are, let me know and I'll join!)&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;If there's an attempt to restart the stack in the future, I'd be happy to up the level of my involvement. In the meantime, I'll monitor the digital preservation tag on the LIS stack.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://sils.unc.edu/events/2013/closing-digital-gap" />
