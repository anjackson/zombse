How should the FAQ define the target audience?
=====================
This is a spin-off from the discussion of the question "Are research
questions acceptable?" Currently the FAQ says: "Digital Preservation -
Stack Exchange is for professionals working to ensure long term access
to digital objects." Do we really want it to be *only* for
professionals, or should the characterization be broadened, e.g., by
saying "professionals and students"? Should any other groups be
included?

* Paul Wheatley: Professionals, researchers and students? We've had some good questions
and answers already from "amateur" digital preservationists. So I'm not
even sure restricting it this tightly makes any sense at all.
* mopennock: Couldn't we just say 'anyone'?
* mopennock: Who has power to edit the FAQ?
* Donald.McLean: I assume editing the FAQ is a diamond moderator thing.
