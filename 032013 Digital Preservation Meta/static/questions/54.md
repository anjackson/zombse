How to migrate questions to other SE?
=====================
According to [the announcement this beta will close on 18
March](http://meta.digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/50/digital-preservation-se-will-close-on-march-18?cb=1).

Is it possible to migrate the best questions to either [Super
User](http://superuser.com/) or [Libraries and Information
Science](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/), with answers, comments
etc.?

According to the announcement such questions would be on-topic on that
site, so it would be better to migrate them with answers than to re-ask
them.
