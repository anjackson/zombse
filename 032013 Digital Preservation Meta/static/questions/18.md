Should verb tags become gerunds?
=====================
I see that
[publishing](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/publishing "show questions tagged 'publishing'")
[future-proofing](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/future-proofing "show questions tagged 'future-proofing'")
[imaging](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/imaging "show questions tagged 'imaging'")
and similar verb tags end in "ing" to make the action a noun. (Not
counting verb tags with established noun forms like
[data-curation](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-curation "show questions tagged 'data-curation'")
[corruption](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/corruption "show questions tagged 'corruption'")
[organization](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/organization "show questions tagged 'organization'").)

-   Should
    [digitize](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/digitize "show questions tagged 'digitize'"),
    which refers to the action, rename to
    [digitizing](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/digitizing "show questions tagged 'digitizing'")
    (or
    [digitization](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/digitization "show questions tagged 'digitization'"))?
-   Should
    [archive](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archive "show questions tagged 'archive'")
    (the action) â†’
    [archiving](http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archiving "show questions tagd 'archiving'")?
-   And so on

Yes. I'd also suggest changing "archive-format" to "archival-format" and
"out-of-date-format" to "obsolete-format". A bit of maintenance of tags
early on should help these to develop in a sensible way. Is there anyone
with the authority to do this yet?
