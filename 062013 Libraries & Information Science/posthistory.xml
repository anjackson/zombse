These restrictions vary, and are typically established by the lending library.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Some university libraries will only loan a thesis if they have&#xD;&#xA;   multiple physical copies, so as to reduce the risk of &quot;the only copy&quot;&#xD;&#xA;   going unreturned.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA; - The lending library may specify that your library must not permit you&#xD;&#xA;   to leave the premises with the thesis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to the above, it's also possible that the PhD student has specified  restrictions be placed on distribution when depositing their thesis. A thesis may be embargoed for a specific period of time at the student's option.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, graduate students at the University of Illinois can select from a number of different &quot;release options&quot; when depositing the electronic copy of their thesis:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Open Access&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - U of I Only&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - Closed Access&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(see [Thesis release options/Patent FAQs](http://www.grad.illinois.edu/thesis-faqs#Thesis_release_options) for more details on each)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some libraries partner with commercial services to archive their students theses. These companies can then offer access to the full thesis, sometimes for an additional fee or included in your library's subscription to a specific database offering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps the most well-known company in this space us UMI / Proquest. See their [Finding the dissertation or thesis you need](http://www.proquest.com/en-US/products/dissertations/finding.shtml) page for a link to a number of their products.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;University libraries are making great strides in placing theses online in institutional repositories. This eliminates a lot of the concerns regarding preservation of the &quot;only&quot; physical copy, and can even eliminate the need for an ILL request. Access permissions (you guessed it) can vary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary: since restrictions vary, either contact your local library's ILL librarian, or research the matter on the lending library's web site (try the pages intended for other libraries or those intended for students depositing their thesis).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may also have good luck contacting the student directly.

It is commonly used in research and academic libraries. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the [Library of Congress][2] website explains: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The system divides all knowledge into twenty-one basic classes, each&#xD;&#xA;&gt; identified by a single letter of the alphabet. Most of these&#xD;&#xA;&gt; alphabetical classes are further divided into more specific&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subclasses, identified by two-letter, or occasionally three-letter,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; combinations. For example, class N, Art, has subclasses NA,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Architecture; NB, Sculpture, ND, Painting; as well as several other&#xD;&#xA;&gt; subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific&#xD;&#xA;&gt; places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; LCC may range from one to four digits in length, and may be further&#xD;&#xA;&gt; extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral ,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics&#xD;&#xA;&gt; under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also the [NLM classification][3] that is used more often in medical libraries. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The NLM Classification covers the field of medicine and related&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sciences. The scheme is a system of classification intended to be used&#xD;&#xA;&gt; for the shelf arrangement of all library materials, regardless of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; format. Designed as a broad classification, it is suitable for both&#xD;&#xA;&gt; large and small library collections and may be adapted to handle&#xD;&#xA;&gt; specialized collections of any size.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The NLM Classification is a system of mixed notation patterned after&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the Library of Congress (LC) Classification where alphabetical letters&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which denote broad subject categories are further subdivided by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; numbers. The NLM Classification utilizes schedules QS-QZ and W-WZ,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; permanently excluded from the LC Classification Schedules and is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; intended to be used with the LC schedules which supplement the NLM&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Classification for subjects bordering on medicine and for general&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reference materials. The LC schedules for Human Anatomy (QM),&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Microbiology (QR), and Medicine (R) are not used at all by the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; National Library of Medicine since they overlap the NLM&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Classification.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also the [BISAC system][4], which is used mainly for booksellers, but also has been adapted for library use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The BISAC Subject Headings List, also known as the BISAC Subject Codes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; List, is a standard used by many companies throughout the supply chain&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to categorize books based on topical content. The Subject Heading&#xD;&#xA;&gt; applied to a book can determine where the work is shelved in a brick&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and mortar store or the genre(s) under which it can be searched for in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an internal database.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another option is the [Universal Decimal Classification][5] system. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is the world's foremost&#xD;&#xA;&gt; multilingual classification scheme for all fields of knowledge, a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sophisticated indexing and retrieval tool. It was adapted by Paul&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Otlet (Rayward's Otlet page; Wikipedia entry ) and Nobel Prizewinner&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Henri La Fontaine from the Decimal Classification of Melvil Dewey, and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; first published (in French) between 1904 and 1907. Since then, it has&#xD;&#xA;&gt; been extensively revised and developed, and has become a highly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flexible and effective system for organizing bibliographic records for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; all kinds of information in any medium (it is well suited to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; multi-media information collections). It is structured in such a way&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that new developments and new fields of knowledge can be readily&#xD;&#xA;&gt; incorporated. The code itself is independent of any particular&#xD;&#xA;&gt; language or script (consisting of arabic numerals and common&#xD;&#xA;&gt; punctuation marks), and the accompanying class descriptions have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; appeared in many translated versions. UDC is in worldwide use, and has&#xD;&#xA;&gt; been published in whole or in part in 40 different languages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also various classification systems in other languages, such as [Chinese Library Classification][6], and the Russian [BBK Classification][7] System.  &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcc.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/nlmclassif.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.bisg.org/activities-programs/activity.php?n=d&amp;id=73&amp;cid=20&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.udcc.org/about.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Library_Classification&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.indiana.edu/~libslav/slavcatman/bbkover.html" />

There will also be a transitional period while you convert your collection to RFID.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many of these concerns applied to your library when it first automated its collection and converted its card catalog, of course.

The feeding of silverfish results in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; irregular feeding areas that exhibit characteristic &quot;thin spots&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Silverfish do not have strong chewing mouth parts and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; therefore tend to sit on the surface of the paper and gradually abrade&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the surface. In some areas of the damage, the feeding will result in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; irregular holes in the paper. In other areas, however, the feeding&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will not break entirely through the paper and will result in thin&#xD;&#xA;&gt; spots or simply the removal of the printed word.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; When silverfish feed on printed materials, they often leave a fine,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pelletized frass (excrement) which is black and resembles a miniature&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mouse dropping. Under magnification, this residue is fairly easily&#xD;&#xA;&gt; distinguished as individual pellets or droppings. This material&#xD;&#xA;&gt; accumulates under items or may be scattered randomly over surfaces in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; darkened areas. It may also be found on the interior of acid-free&#xD;&#xA;&gt; storage boxes. Large amounts of frass may be found in attics insulated&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with cellulose insulation (ground up newsprint).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They prefer moist, dark environments, so ensuring that they don't have that kind of environment to thrive in will go a long way to ensuring the safety of the books and other materials. [This article][2] speaks mainly of silverfish in houses, not libraries, but the advice holds. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Silverfish are usually introduced into houses from an outside source. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Prevention of silverfish infestations should begin with sanitation. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Vacuum cracks and crevices to remove dust and lint.  Keep bookcases&#xD;&#xA;&gt; clean by vacuuming and shaking out books.  Don’t allow piles of old&#xD;&#xA;&gt; papers and magazines to accumulate.  Check old books before bringing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; them into the house.  Store starched linens in sealed plastic bags. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Seal cracks and crevices with caulking compound to reduce the number&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of hiding places. Make the environment less attractive by reducing the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; humidity with a dehumidifier. Anhydrous calcium carbonate, a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dehydrating agent, is effective in removing moisture from the air in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; closets and other small spaces.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also chemical solutions to silverfish problems, but those can also harm the books and other materials - these solutions are best left to people with more expertise in these things, especially where a library collection is concerned. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.unesco.org/webworld/ramp/html/r8820e/r8820e05.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.wvu.edu/~exten/infores/pubs/pest/hpm8002.pdf" />

I've seen some with no members from management; they came up with wonderful ideas but had no authority or resources to put them in practice. This is a hard political problem; one way to attack it is to rotate membership on innovation committees, so that no one gets entrenched and everyone gets heard. Alternately, for each proposal, figure out which sections of staff would be affected and put a representative from each affected section on the project group for that specific project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Change management* would be my third Big Question. There's no point in starting a think tank if it's surrounded by immovable cement roadblocks... and that's as far as I'm willing to take that metaphor.

Any of the options may be combined as you see fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some of the options may not be suitable for all collections. Some of these might not strictly qualify as &quot;backups&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Almost Free ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Accession by Others as Backup ###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you upload your collection (or a portion of your collection) to [the Internet Archive](http://archive.org/) or [The Commons](http://www.flickr.com/commons) on Flickr, there's now one more copy than there was before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Ad-hoc Reciprocal Storage ###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Find one or more organizations with similar interests or needs, and arrange to keep a copy of each other's data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can make this as simple or as complex as you want. Ideally, it should be automated unless your data is extremely static.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Options include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Exchange data on physical storage medium (hard drive, flash storage, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;- Set up a Linux box at each organization and use rsync over ssh to distribute data&#xD;&#xA;- Use a BitTorrent client with some form of automatic polling&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The BitTorrent option doesn't have a lot of benefit if there are only two sites participating. If you are looking at a larger number of sites, you may wish to consider the next option.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Private LOCKSS Network ###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a lot of ways, a &quot;private&quot; LOCKSS network (as opposed to participation in the &quot;global&quot; LOCKSS network) is similar to the ad-hoc options listed above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There will be some setup involved, and you may need to dedicate more computing resources to it than the ad-hoc methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One advantage of LOCKSS is that a lot of thought has gone into handling issues which you'll be dealing with yourself in some of the ad-hoc methods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also benefits from having a catchy name. ;-) (albeit trademarked -- read on)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [LOCKSS software](http://sourceforge.net/projects/lockss/) itself is available under an open source (BSD) license. It's unclear if you need any kind of license to use the LOCKSS name itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Inexpensive ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Take External Media Offsite ###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Get a few hard drives or flash drives, and instead of exchanging them with another organization, place them in a safe deposit box or (depending on policy/etc) have staff members store them at home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Simple but not automated, and somewhat more feasible due to the likely public nature of the data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Commercial Online Backup Services ###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are perhaps the most generic &quot;backing up any kind of data&quot; solutions. Your data is likely be have a different profile than traditional &quot;backing up everyone's Documents folders in my company&quot;, so watch out for fine print in terms of &quot;unlimited storage for a single computer&quot; plans. Your data may not qualify.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some providers / services:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [CrashPlan Pro](http://www.crashplan.com/business/)&#xD;&#xA; - [BackBlaze](http://www.backblaze.com/business.html)&#xD;&#xA; - [Tarsnap](http://www.tarsnap.com/)&#xD;&#xA; - [Jungle Disk Business](https://www.jungledisk.com/business/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some online backup services make use of storage platforms provided by other companies. See the next option for how you may be able to cut out the middleman by using those services directly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Commodity Cloud Storage ###&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a number of companies providing storage platforms supported by Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). You can use open source tools to copy your data into the storage platforms, where the data is then replicated to multiple physical locations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Software:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) -- Linux, Windows, OS X&#xD;&#xA; - [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) -- OS X&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(there are a huge number of software packages out there with support for these kinds of storage platforms, both open source and not)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This option is perhaps the easiest to put a price tag on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yearly cost for 20 GB of storage:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/): ~$30 ($0.125/GB/mo)&#xD;&#xA; - [Google Cloud Storage](https://developers.google.com/storage/): ~$28.80 ($0.12/GB/mo)&#xD;&#xA; - [Rackspace CloudFiles](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/): ~$36 ($0.15/GB/mo)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Providers may have specials for new users (X gb/mo free for the first Y months).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your per-gigabyte costs may decrease with these providers once you pass a certain threshold. There's at least one study which indicates you can get better value from doing it yourself at certain levels of storage, but your mileage may vary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pricing is very similar, so you may want to pick the software first and the platform second -- unless you have a strong preference for/against any of the companies in question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Extremely Generic Conclusion ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some creative ways to back up digital collections. Use what works for you, start with the size you need, grow as you need to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thanks for putting thought into keeping your collection safe!" />

So they can check out books, search the catalog, find out your hours, etc. all from the convenience of their mobile phone. Many of these tasks are difficult if not impossible for mobile users on a desktop website; mobile screens are so small &amp; struggle with basic navigational features (tiny link text, drop-down menus) that most would give up rather than continue on their way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the real question is: _what is the advantage of a native library app over a mobile website_. That answer is less clear. The tasks that both Kode and Jeanne name (locations, hours, phone numbers, calendars, catalogue searches, placing holds, &amp; look up hours, titles, reserve books) do not require any special native technology. A mobile website would suit these fine.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, I don't think a native app is a good choice if you're not going to use the advantages of the native platform: are you planning to tap into device APIs? Do you need persistent storage (hint: none of the actions above do)? Would the app often be used offline? Does your site use the camera? If the answer to those is no, then you're creating more problems that solutions with an app. App's have to versioned: you'll need _at least_ an Android and an iOS one, but other OSes can always gain market share (Windows Phone, BlackBerry, etc.) and backwards compatibility can break with OS upgrades. A mobile website renders across devices fine; one could, for instance, employ [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) to ensure that a site runs across [all major devices](http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/). You also need to pay fees to have apps listed in proprietary, closed markets like the App Store whereas the web is open and accessible to all. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, HTML5 is rapidly narrowing the gap between native applications on both desktop and mobile operating systems and the capabilities of the web. I would also argue that the skills for developing mobile-optimized websites (generally HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) are more common than the ones for native apps (mostly Objective C on iOS, mostly Java on Android, though both can use WebKit views to run apps written in web languages like the Facebook iOS app does).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know it's awful to say &quot;let me answer the question you should have asked&quot; but I feel like the difference between apps &amp; websites often goes unarticulated.

There are a growing number of [Omeka Themes and Plugins](http://omeka.org/add-ons/) available which extend the base install in various ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't have a suitable system on which to install Omeka, you can purchase a hosting plan from [omeka.net](http://www.omeka.net/). There's a free Basic plan, then four additional subscription tiers ranging from $49/year to $999/year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can add a number of different forms of metadata to records (see [this example record](http://localhistory.tadl.org/items/show/10)), and there are also plugins which give you the ability to generate reports from items in Omeka. This could be useful if you have inventory requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since Omeka is built on top of an SQL database (MySQL) which has ODBC connectors available, you could even use your existing expertise to create/adapt Microsoft Access reports that directly query the Omeka database.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Omeka excels at its online presentation of items, but may lack other traditional collection management system features which you may require.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your collection can be well represented by photographs (or if your collection is mainly images), I would strongly suggest you give Omeka consideration.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PastPerfect&#xD;&#xA;-----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My experience with PastPerfect is mostly from the perspective of an interested observer. I was involved in some technical consultation surrounding a grant to obtain/upgrade PastPerfect, and the local history center uses PastPerfect to make some of their collection available online. I've perused the manuals and made use of the public facing parts of the hosted web services but not utilized the software that museum personnel would use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PastPerfect is by the vendor's own claims the &quot;most popular&quot; museum collection management software, with &quot;over 8000&quot; clients. Its pricing is known for being within reach of many small to medium museums.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;List pricing from PastPerfect's website is&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - $870 for the basic program&#xD;&#xA; - $385 for the ability to add images to records&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For making your catalog available online:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - $285 for the PastPerfect-Online software&#xD;&#xA; - $440 per year for PastPerfect-Online hosting (first 10,000 records)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also the option of purchasing their Virtual Exhibit product ($445 list price).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Virtual Exhibit lets you build exhibits and host them on a web server you provide. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PastPerfect-Online allows you to put your entire collection online, and is hosted by PastPerfect for an annual fee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following record is hosted via PastPerfect-Online: [Postcard of the Ladies Library on Cass Street](http://grandtraverse.pastperfect-online.com/36237cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=45035304-EB3B-47C2-ABCF-684597346422;type=102)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PastPerfect includes some more traditional collection management system features that Omeka does not focus on, and also includes membership and donor management functions to facilitate fundraising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some features require you to pay additional license fees, such as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - inventory&#xD;&#xA; - support for multiple users on a network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conclusion&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based only on my personal experience:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If traditional collection management system features are a must, consider PastPerfect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If your goal is to present your collection online, consider Omeka.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're looking for both, I'd look into the experiences others have had with exporting data from PastPerfect to Omeka. See the [Omeka forums](http://omeka.org/forums/) and the [omeka-dev mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/omeka-dev) for further details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have development expertise or a budget to sponsor work to be contributed back to Omeka, you might consider adding the features you require which Omeka does not currently have." />

While reading a paper book is self explanatory, there's a steeper learning curve for ebooks.  Patrons may need teaching on how to use the ereader in general and will certainly need training on how to use it with the library's software, especially since publishers can and do make libraries jump through more hoops to read an ebook.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Providing access to the ebooks is another important aspect.  Do you simply host a collection and let patrons do their own downloading from home or from a app?  Or do you have computer stations set up with the software to allow them to download at the library.  And do you lend the ereaders themselves?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Touching on dsalo's point, the library does not own the ebook when it is purchased.  The library owns particular rights to using it that can often hinge on rules set by the publisher--a limited number of circulations, a set time frame in which the ebook is available, the 'one copy one patron' rule.  This also means that library access to purchases through a specific vendor may disappear when leaving the vendor or if the vendor shuts down, losing the money as well as materials.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the side of benefits, providing ebooks and training will be great for getting the public to see libraries as current &amp; necessary--and not rooted solely in the paper object.  eBooks also allow libraries to be 'always' available (at least to patrons with home computer access)--those collections will be open even when the library is closed.

(and MS Word is particularly tricky, as it stores the content out of order, so it can handle undo)  Yet, it's perfectly normal to assign a DOI that takes you to a page asking you what format you want to download in item in.  (typically PDF + something else)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PDF's another problematic one, as it's more a layout language ... this word gets placed in a particular spot on a page (which is why you'll try to select a block of text in columns, but it'll select across multiple columns)... you could have multiple files that generate an identical printed page.  The whole thing might be an image ... or an image + tagged text ... or text laid out any number of ways.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The stuff that I work with is multi-dimensional scientific data.  We have lots of problems regarding serialization which may or may not be the 'same' content (eg, if you convert integer datum to floats, so there's no loss of precision or addition of error, is it still the 'same'?)  But even without that, we have column-major form vs. row-major form.  Eg:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    1 2 3&#xD;&#xA;    4 5 6&#xD;&#xA;    7 8 9&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can store this as either `[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]` or `[1 4 7] [2 5 8] [3 6 9]`, and so long as you have the correct metadata to explain the serialization, you can get back to the 'same' content.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another problem I've run into are people suggesting that we include checksums of some sort in data citations.

However, there are factors a university special collections/archives will consider when determining whether to (1) accept the archives of a professor and (2) to determine what in that professor's archives holds archival value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All archives face challenges of space and staffing constraints. Most archives don't have the luxury of empty shelving awaiting new fonds (a person's archives), and the nature of archives and archival operations makes it difficult to weed out materials (deaccession) that have already been formally acquired by an archives (archival principles such as the archival bond and the principle of provenance, and administrative hurdles such as donor agreements are some of the challenges to deaccession). Most archives don't have the staff hours necessary to process and provide access to the materials it accepts. This necessarily limits the number of faculty fonds a university archives can accept, so the archives will have to consider, amongst other factor, the relationship between the faculty member and the university and the contributions the faculty member has made to his/her field when deciding whether his/her fonds will be accepted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the faculty member's fonds is accepted, the archives will need to conduct an archival appraisal to determine which records hold the most archival value (which records provide evidence of significant transactions, which records contain the most informational value, etc.). For some records, laws on privacy make deposit in an archives unfeasible—in most jurisdictions, legislation places additional requirements on protection of privacy in medical and student records (in the United States, for example, these areas fall under HIPAA and FERPA, respectively). Some records duplicate information found in another record in a more efficient or effective form (final versions vs. drafts, or a course syllabus that describes major assignments, rather than the description sheets for each assignment). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Archival appraisal is always a balancing act between a desire to preserve the integrity of a person's fonds while recognizing an archives' inability to preserve everything and there is no international standard available to guide archivists on how to proceed. Indeed, it's an area of archival science that is fairly contentious.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To think about how few of the records created by an institution end up in an archives, in most national governments, only about 5–10% of the records created by the government will make it into the country's archives. On a more personal level, think about your desk. Would you want to preserve every piece of paper that is on your desk and every file you have stored on your computer? You'd probably want to do some weeding before giving your records over to an archives.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Do members agree on that?  &#xD;&#xA; - Efficiency: What part of the innovation is actually *improved* by having a committee and not just, say, a working group, task force or hackathon?  A committee is a political body.  It is suboptimal for creative and engineering processes.  What political problem are you solving?  Are you stuck trying to solve an engineering problem through &quot;discussion&quot; or a political problem through code?  This comes back to scope.&#xD;&#xA; - Power: Imagine you succeed and determine *some damn thing* is the best course of action.  What happens?  Can you actually hire people, set policy or acquire/deploy resources?  Another way of saying this is: what is the *output* of group?  Is it adequate to the scope of the problem or are you getting all the responsibility and none of the authority?&#xD;&#xA; - Skillz: Interestingly, I don't think you need to staff the committee with mainly hardcore engineers.  In practice the main value of a committee member is bullshit detection (because any chump can repeat what the last vendor salesman has been telling them -- if you say you need innovation, they are sure to have some for sale) and a strong understanding of your business.  &#xD;&#xA; - Recognition problem: innovation is already happening, both inside your organization(s) and elsewhere.  Would you know it if you saw it?  You should be able to find it in your problem-space and identify why it isn't *already* sufficient to be your solution, or the basis for your solution.  This is the Turing Test of your raison d'être.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other than that, &quot;Innovation Committee&quot; is a pretty funny joke in just two words.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Looking at Dewey, or Library of Congress, or other systems might give you inspiration, of course. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, while I'm happy to use those systems in my professional life, they don't fit my personal library at all - I have large numbers of books in areas both LOC and Dewey handle quite badly (religion that isn't Christianity, mythology, the use of technology tools). So I sort these sections in an order that makes sense for me. And within fiction, I prefer to browse and therefore sort by very specific sub-genre (urban fantasy, historical mystery, etc.) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other part has to do with the practical realities of space use: if I have 5 shelves worth of a general subject, I'm going to store those somewhere I have space for those five shelves, even if logically, they might fit better between one topic and another. Or I might choose to store those books in the room where I use them a lot. Home use has considerations a public space doesn't. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One informal option for managing a collection is using a catalog (I use LibraryThing, but there are plenty of others) that will let you tag with different topics - that way, it's easy (once I set the tags) to browse a list of items about a particular subject even if they might be shelved in varied places for other reasons (size, where I'm most likely to want to use them.)

Big question. Here are the assumptions I'm working from (correct me if any are wrong):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The charge is set and cannot be changed at this juncture.&#xD;&#xA; - The group is supposed to feed new projects and/or services back into the rest of the staff (as opposed to a Clayton Christensen-style independent offshoot).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Process* would be my first Big Question. Who suggests ideas to the innovation committee, and how do they do it? Once an idea is on the table, how does the committee make a yea-or-nay decision on it, and who has (de facto or de jure) veto power on a yea decision? Are promising ideas piloted? How? For how long? How are pilot projects assessed for promotion to standard library services? Must all changes the library or any segment thereof are contemplating feed through this committee? If not, which changes do and which don't?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(It needs to be clear from the outset that pilot-project failure is not only an option, it's an *expectation*. The only alternatives to that are bad ones: only the blandest, timidest ideas survive, or ideas that are bad or unworkable for whatever reason but still make it through the committee never manage to die. Fail, sweep up after the failure, move on with analysis but sans blame.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Committee membership* would be my second Big Question. I've seen &quot;innovation committees&quot; that were cliques. I've seen ones whose members were honestly desirous of innovating, but whose excluded colleagues believed the committee was a clique, or felt excluded for other reasons (&quot;nobody from [x library division] is on that group, so clearly they don't care what we think!&quot;). I've seen some with no members from management; they came up with wonderful ideas but had no authority or resources to put them in practice. This is a hard political problem; one way to attack it is to rotate membership on innovation committees, so that no one gets entrenched and everyone gets heard. Alternately, for each proposal, figure out which sections of staff would be affected and put a representative from each affected section on the project group for that specific project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Change management* would be my third Big Question. There's no point in starting a think tank if it's surrounded by immovable cement roadblocks... and that's as far as I'm willing to take that metaphor. Is the think tank responsible for selling an innovation? To whom (administration, staff, patrons)? What happens when the think tank has to deal with unjustified change resistance (n.b. not all change resistance is unjustified)?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Good luck. I have to admit my instinctive reaction to this question was &quot;here there bee dragons.&quot;" />

But! If those aren't your thing, here are some thoughts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Music**: You could play a recorded song. Kids could be encouraged to dance or to follow the motions in the song, or it could simply be relaxing lap time. When the music is over, storytime is over.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Stamp or sticker**: Sometimes I end storytime with a hand stamp (or sticker). This gives the kids an opportunity to practice the skill of forming a line (useful later in school) and gives me a chance to chat briefly with each child. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Bubbles**: Some folks finish by blowing bubbles. This is especially popular with 2- and 3-year-olds. To avoid a stampede, it can be helpful to form kids into a circle and blow bubbles toward each child. Some people sing &quot;Goodbye Bubble&quot; during this (it helps create a sense of ending, especially when the song stops), but you could skip the song, simply speak the words, have the parents sing it, or play a recorded version. (To the tune of *Frere Jacques*: Goodbye bubbles, goodbye bubbles; Time to go, time to go; I will help you, I will help you; With a blow, with a blow.&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Toys, scarves or activities**: Some storytimes end by transitioning into a free play period, sometimes with coloring sheets, crafts, toys, or scarves to play with. I like what MariBar said about this allowing time for us to interact with families.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Rhyme**: What about a closing rhyme that is not a fingerplay or song, but simply spoken? A search for &quot;storytime closing rhymes&quot; (or &quot;storytime opening closing rhymes&quot;) turns up a variety. (You don't care for fingerplays, but do you mind action rhymes that involve larger motor skills like clapping or patting one's knees? Just establishing a rhythm with their bodies tends to gather the kids' attention and create a sense of ritual.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Ritual**: I think the main thing is to create a sense of ritual, so that children recognize a familiar cue that storytime is about to end. Everyone could wave goodbye; you could sound a gong or ring a bell (or all the kids could); you could all pretend to go to sleep; you could review together the storytime's highlights (good for reinforcing narrative skills) and then all declare &quot;Ta-da!&quot; ... anything!" />

We index the OCR with [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/), which is a web service wrapper around the [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core) search library. Lucene's [scoring algorithm](http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_0/scoring.html) uses [Vector Space Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Space_Model) and [tf-idf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf*idf) for ranking. What this basically means is summed up in the Lucene document:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;&#xA;In general, the idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that document is to the query.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is why you often see pages with lots of pictures, and little text on them, at the top of search results, since the ratio of the matched words to the words on the page is higher than pages with more words on them. Sometimes we joke that the search is actually a historic comic strip search engine :-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The OCR quality does vary from newspaper to newspaper, depending on the quality of the microfilm that was digitized, and the quality of the newspaper that was microfilmed. It can be *very* noisy indeed. We actually expose the OCR for pages, which you can get by clicking on the &quot;Text&quot; hyperlink when viewing a newspaper page. Here's an [example](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89066313/1912-05-24/ed-1/seq-1/ocr/) There are links to a plain text and OCR XML version of the OCR at the bottom.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We are actually in the process of bundling up the newspaper OCR for bulk download so that researchers, partners and other interested folks can index the content easily. If you have any ideas for improving search, or questions about failing searches we would love to hear them. There are knobs to turn in Solr for boosting fields, and changing the way indexing is performed, so there is definitely room for improvement.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Chronicling America codebase is currently available on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/loc-ndnp/), and you can email the [mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=loc-ndnp-mail) if you want to get in touch.

There is often playtime and the babies rarely stay confined to laps, although it's a secure place to start, and including &quot;lapsit&quot; in the name highlights the concept that the storytime is fun and cuddly, emphasizing adult/child bonding and interaction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lapsit/baby storytime gives the babies a chance to hear lots of language, and the families opportunities to connect with each other. Basically it can have most of the typical storytime elements, but geared to babies' development, and with a bit of a focus on helping the caregivers develop skills and a repertoire. A librarian may focus on such things as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - welcoming families to the library (for many with babies it's their first visit, or their first with children) and assuring them that we don't mind babies' chaos, noise, or propensity to chew on things&#xD;&#xA; - modeling interactive language moments &#xD;&#xA; - encouraging adults to share songs, rhymes and stories with their babies&#xD;&#xA; - sharing the [early literacy benefits][1] of doing so&#xD;&#xA; - sharing [other research][2] about babies' language and pre-literacy development (in a fun, [concise way][3])&#xD;&#xA; - supporting and encouraging caregivers' roles in baby language development&#xD;&#xA; - providing age-appropriate materials such as board books (especially in black and white or with photos of babies' faces, for the youngest ones) and song sheets&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But fundamentally the same principles hold true as with other storytimes: have fun, share books, develop literacy and language!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.multcolib.org/birthtosix/earlyliteracy.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.multcolib.org/birthtosix/braindev.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.multcolib.org/birthtosix/babies.html" />

In this sense, it ends up having a lot to do with imagining what it is that might be the problem and first trying to isolate and make that problem reproducible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this said, there are some very real basic vocabulary problems that can come up. I remember once when I spent about five minutes explaining what &quot;drag and drop&quot; meant to a guy who wanted to use Zotero. My hope is that he is now dragging and doping things all over the place. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, a friend, who works in IT for a school district recently had a user who reported that they couldn't get on the school website from home. Initial questioning revealed that the user could not access any web pages from home. Further questioning revealed that the user did not have an internet service provider. They had a school given laptop and they thought since the internet is wireless these days that the school laptop would just get that wireless from their house. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this is to say that IT people in a support role are going to be constantly trying to gauge where you are at in the continuum of computer wisdom. The more specific and detailed information you can give, ideally with information about how you tried a few different ways and can clearly reproduce your problem, the more likely they can help you quickly. Keep in mind that they need to figure out if you are someone who has no idea about computers, someone who needs to be taught drag and drop or who needs to have the nature of internet service providers explained to them.

Smaller file sizes.&#xD;&#xA;2. Imperfections in the original (coffee stains?) are less noticeable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Color should only ever be important when the original is in color, and information would thus be lost by storing B&amp;W.  The other reason to archive a color version is to reproduce (physically or electronically) something as close to the original as possible (coffee stains included!).  This motivation is generally only interesting for objects of historical significance, so probably not so much for most dissertations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Keep in mind this is meant to answer the question of how to archive the information.

(even if it's 'I turned on my computer' ... you did *something* to trigger the problem)&#xD;&#xA;* What response did you get?  (if it gave a message, give us the *exact* string, not 'something about memory')&#xD;&#xA;* Was it a one-time thing, or can you re-create it?&#xD;&#xA;* Is it only your computer, or are other people having the problem, too?&#xD;&#xA;* When did it start happening?  (and did anything change since then? ... and yes, installing a screensaver you found on the internet, or opening that email attachment telling you about your winnings in the lottery you don't remember entering counts as a change)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;'It doesn't work' or 'my computer is slow' is about as useful as going to a librarian and saying, 'I'm looking for a book'.  We need a lot more information than that.  So, for example, good trouble reports:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* I was looking at (website), and was at (URL), when I tried to click on the link titled (title).  My computer locked up with no error messages, and I had to reboot to clear it.  I was using (browser, version) on (machine name) running (OS, version), and I believe I had (list of applications) open at the time.  I tried it after rebooting, and it locked up again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* I was using (application), and I tried to use (feature) in the (menu) menu.  It gave me a message (*exact* error string, not some paraphrase).  It had worked yesterday with this same document.  I tried other documents, and they don't complain, but this one always does.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem is that with software, we don't necessarily know what's important or not, so as Henry said, it's going to be like a reference interview, as they try to get various bits of information from you to try to narrow down the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you can, learn how to take screen shots on your computer -- on MacOS, it's command-shift-3 (you'll hear a camera click sound bite) or for a region, cmd-shift-4 and you'll get cross-hairs to drag a box.  For a window, cmd-shift-4, then spacebar, and it'll give you a icon of a camera and you can click on the window of interest.  In current versions of MacOS, you'll get a file named 'Screen shot (date) at (time)' on your desktop.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(but if you take more than one, only send them the one that shows the error message or the problem ... you can tell 'em you have more pictures if they need it ... sending 20MB of attachments w/ the trouble ticket isn't productive)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then try re-creating the problem (assuming it isn't 'hey, there's smoke coming from my computer' ... yes, we've gotten those calls before ... and if you're going to make that call, please make a note of what color smoke it is, after you've unplugged the machine), and ask your co-workers if they can re-create it, so we know if it's a localized problem or not.  You can then call in one ticket that something's wrong, rather than have *everyone* in the department call in that you can't get to the internet.  (yes, we know, and if we didn't have people keep coming in telling us 'the internet is down', we'd likely be able to get it back up faster.  Yes, we know we said give us 30 minutes 45 minutes ago, but you have to add 5 minutes for every other person who came in to bug us)" />

In this sense, it ends up having a lot to do with imagining what it is that might be the problem and first trying to isolate and make that problem reproducible. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this said, there are some very real basic vocabulary problems that can come up. I remember once when I spent about five minutes explaining what &quot;drag and drop&quot; meant to a guy who wanted to use Zotero. My hope is that he is now dragging and dropping things all over the place. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, a friend, who works in IT for a school district recently had a user who reported that they couldn't get on the school website from home. Initial questioning revealed that the user could not access any web pages from home. Further questioning revealed that the user did not have an internet service provider. They had a school given laptop and they thought since the internet is wireless these days that the school laptop would just get that wireless from their house. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this is to say that IT people in a support role are going to be constantly trying to gauge where you are at in the continuum of computer wisdom. The more specific and detailed information you can give, ideally with information about how you tried a few different ways and can clearly reproduce your problem, the more likely they can help you quickly. Keep in mind that they need to figure out if you are someone who has no idea about computers, someone who needs to be taught drag and drop or who needs to have the nature of internet service providers explained to them.

Instead of asking John Doe who happens to come into the library a lot what books he wants, ask the head of the local home-school association, the chairpersons of local HOAs, the local environmental group, area PTA presidents, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, area book clubs. These people can tell you what is on folks' minds.

I think the answer to your question reflects organizational realities more than technological ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The libraries I've worked in had an entire department devoted to MARC cataloging. Anything else lived in the wainscoting -- the impoverished digital library, or the starved, staggering, scorned institutional repository. Whatever Those People Over There did, to a cataloger, was &quot;non-MARC data,&quot; and you'd better believe it wasn't as important or as professional as MARC. Were Those People Over There *even librarians*? Some catalogers said not, frankly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(There's a strain of rhetoric in the &quot;whither libraries?&quot; literature that bolsters this organizational dysfunction: it holds that MARC is one of librarianship's central mysteries, such that veering away from it means abandoning librarianship altogether. Michael Gorman and Martha Yee write in this mode, among others.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The world is changing, of course. &quot;Non-MARC data,&quot; even if we just consider it &quot;library-created or library-held metadata in a form other than MARC,&quot; probably outweighs MARC data bit for bit by now. (This is a mildly unfair comparison, because MARC was designed for economy of storage, and XML was not. Even so.) Measuring by current-processing output, non-MARC data probably gives MARC a run for its money these days, considering how mainstream digitization has become, and how relatively simple and automatable it is to create much non-MARC data compared to MARC/AACR2/ISBD. (I grant you, PREMIS is a bear.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the linguistic markedness of MARC (see what I did there?) doesn't reflect production volume or holdings volume, much less a measure of impact on patrons or on the world.

This would comply with copyright and allow for individual departments to acquire a digital collection slowly but surely.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some areas, I would question whether the material is suitable for digitization, such as art books; but by doing this slowly, it could be a learning process to see what works and what doesn't." />

In an increasingly web-integrated and machine-readable world, the traditional citation could be enhanced through the use of these unique identifiers. They would point directly and unambiguously to your resource that was cited or otherwise used in the new work, and provide a machine-readable mechanism for pulling together various different uses of the same material. Initiatives like the Open Annotation Collaboration (http://www.openannotation.org/) would strongly benefit from such an approach when used as a part of digital annotations or other secondary works, even if your material that's being cited or used is not (yet?) digital. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say this is easy - identifier management is indeed quite hard. I agree with Ed that a coherent namespace policy is the key, no matter which particular identifier scheme is implemented.

Each year, all interested librarians sign up to be a potential mentor. These librarians submit a short bio of themselves that includes their research interests, their work areas, and other non-work info if desired. These profiles are posted on our staff website. When a new librarian is hired, that person can peruse the profiles of the mentors and choose who s/he would like to be paired with. The mentoring program is only a couple years old, but participation is good so far. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are some factors that make our mentoring program attractive to mentors and mentees:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Mentor and mentee participation is completely optional.&#xD;&#xA; - Mentees don't have to seek out the mentorship program - it's offered automatically when they join the organization.&#xD;&#xA; - The mentee has a way to peruse the profiles of all mentors and is free to choose whoever they'd like as a mentor. No one is assigned a mentor unless they request an assignment (understandable if there are a lot of mentors to choose from!)&#xD;&#xA; - Mentorships can cross departmental/functional boundaries, i.e. a new systems librarian can be mentored by an archivist.&#xD;&#xA; - There's no regulation of what the mentor/mentee relationship looks like. Mentor and mentee set their own parameters for the relationship. There is no required end-of-year report. &#xD;&#xA; - As @user306 mentioned, mentors/mentees are allowed to meet during work hours.&#xD;&#xA; - Our library doesn't do this, but it would also be great if mentees could choose multiple mentors: one for scholarship, one for leadership, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What inspired me to step up: I have benefited greatly from relationships with my mentors, and I am new enough myself to remember what it was like to be starting out at my organization, in my city, and in librarianship." />

Currently, if you don't have  mobile friendly site, users need to pinch and zoom just to interact with the library. A mobile friendly site can alleviate this with the most essential information quickly, hours of operation, current events, catalog link, reference question link. An app creates an advantage since some of it can work offline, it can more easily remember the patron information, and it can utilize other apps on your phone, like a camera app to scan a barcode (browsing in a bookstore, wondering if your library has the book, find out in a snap...) It is a convenience. However, library app vendors can vary in price and in work on your part. I like LibraryThing for Libraries LibraryAnywhere app. It is very inexpensive and has great functionality. It is also a great promotional tool to have your library brand as an app on a patron's phone. " />

The advantage here is that people bookmark URLs, and will create links to your content with them. It is in the best interests of your institution that these URLs are stable, and can persist across content management systems. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fortunately there are lots of software options in the CMS and web framework space that let you manage your URL namespaces. HTTP and DNS software is widely deployed, and has lots of eyes on it, whereas DOI and the [Handle System](http://www.handle.net/) which it relies on are niche technologies that have only a handful of implementations. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My advice is to delay implementing anything like DOIs or Handles and get your institution to instead have a plan for how it manages its URL namespaces.

Some other aspects of a definition that might help: increasing the scale of analysis beyond what's possible in the analog world, insights into analysis gained from collaboration with technical staff, introducing (and sharing with others) fundamentally new methods of analysis, and just opening up your portfolio to new technologically enabled things to do.

Whereas, though this is certainly a generalization, archives have focused on things like provenance and original order---which are not so much user-focused but materials-focused. Museums it seems have a different relationship with users/visitors---one perhaps more centered around exhibits (selected and guided presentations of materials). These different approaches to serving the user (or even thinking about how to serve the user) find reflection in these different kinds of institutions online presences." />

Here are the problems I see spoken of with respect to &quot;library&quot; and &quot;librarian:&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Stereotyped, outdated, inaccurate perception of what libraries are like and what librarians do, especially keen among those who haven't darkened the door of a physical library in years, or ever&#xD;&#xA; - Corollary to the above, libraries and librarians have trouble expanding their remit because of all the stereotype-defiance work that has to be done. (This is perhaps most obvious with respect to digital work done in or by libraries, but information-literacy instruction has had to cope with this also.)&#xD;&#xA; - Strong feminized associations, which subjects libraries and librarians to all the well-known problems of other feminized professions (low pay, low esteem)&#xD;&#xA; - Information work happening outside the physical boundaries of the library (e.g. data curation, records management) doesn't get associated with it, even when the work is performed by librarians.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Changing the generic name of the physical building is unlikely to help with any of the above; recall (those of you who are old enough) the snickering over &quot;sanitation engineers.&quot; If we look like we're trying to cadge unearned prestige (which is, I'm sorry to say, exactly what the ASKPro thing looked like from the outside), we lose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Changing the name of the person or the person's job... might help, at least in some eyes; I don't see any problem with &quot;data curator&quot; or &quot;records manager&quot; or &quot;UX specialist&quot; or even &quot;informationist&quot; or &quot;knowledge manager&quot; (though I have issues with some forms of KM), much less &quot;taxonomist&quot; or &quot;ontologist&quot; or any of the other jobs we do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Perhaps we don't need an overarching identifying term for ourselves any longer.

Let me know in the comments if this is helpful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;About two years ago we joined the bandwagon of libraries putting together web guides for data management. I took a &quot;lifecycle&quot; approach to our guide, and you can check it out [here.][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I met with some colleagues and we felt this was a really &quot;reactive&quot; approach. We formed a small interest group called DIG (yes, &quot;Data Interest Group&quot;), and out of that group we decided to take the issue to our library colleagues via a presentation and discussion which you can find [here.][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The discussion was especially fruitful, and we decided to meet again. We invited some library colleagues to our meeting and held discussion of more proactive models for engaging our faculty. The primary outcome was the formation of our [Research Data Management Guidance][3] team. This group has been instrumental in many spinoff projects including:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Face-to-face consultation on writing data management plans&#xD;&#xA; 2. Presenting to our New Faculty Orientation and our Faculty Seminar series&#xD;&#xA; 3. Presenting to graduate classes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We felt this was a good step, but again--nothing novel. We continued our DIG meetings and tried to drum up a way to have a broader impact--outside of the library. We were aware of an administrative level task force that was looking at some of the larger issues that would challenge the university, but there was little activity on the ground level. We also knew that there were other &quot;worker bee&quot; people like us siloed away in other departments and units, so we decided to reach out to all of the research service providers across campus to invite them to a kind of Meet N' Greet where we could eat bagels and swap stories. It turned out that all of these people were interested in learning about ways to improve the research data services they offered and also advocating for the services of others (e.g. statistical consulting, high performance computing, departmental storage...).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, out of that meeting came two outcomes: the first was to continue our conversation by regularly meeting (quarterly) and to develop a referral network based around the concept of a 'service catalog.' These two outcomes are currently in the works.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, I guess I should say what I learned from this process:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The best way to get engaged is to do the engaging. I've definitely had more consultations as a follow up to a presentation than the website has brought in.&#xD;&#xA; - Form an interest group. Make it a working group, not a committee.&#xD;&#xA; - Reach out to other service providers. Research services are often very distributed; use this to your advantage and engage the people doing the front-line work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.lib.msu.edu/about/diginfo/ldmp.jsp&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://staff.lib.msu.edu/mooneyh/myresearch/DemystifyingDataAndScholarlyCommunication.pptx&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.lib.msu.edu/about/rdmg/index.jsp" />

Librarians can be forgiven for thinking &quot;not yet.&quot;&#xD;&#xA; - Have you been watching the convulsions over small-scale collaborative collection development at all?

We have an donor sheet that we give to faculty members who may be moving institutions or (more commonly) retiring.  Although we have the mandate to collect such material, we also have our larger acquisition mandate that highlights areas of research strength, so we have some wiggle room to say &quot;no thanks&quot; to material that may not fit with our overall holdings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think we would privilege the records of a faculty member who is donating personal records that also document other activities on campus (administrative work, campus life, committees, etc.).  We also collect the records of departments, research centres and university administrative units. The historical culture of our university is such that many units were started as the result of strong-willed individuals, as opposed to 'top-down' administrative decisions.  Sometimes the best way of documenting the actual development of the university is through the records of such individuals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's an excerpt from the acquisition guidelines for faculty papers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;... [the university archives] preserves and makes accessible the personal records of individuals associated with the University whose papers possess enduring value.  When reviewing potential donations to determine if they should be acquired, archivists look for records that reveal influences upon the perspectives of faculty and administrators, provide evidence of their professional and personal activities, and document their contribution to York University or a broader community of interests.  The records should promote an understanding of issues that are likely to be the focus of research in the future, show change over time, and be in good physical condition.  &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Records appear in a wide variety of formats and media.  They include not only &#xD;&#xA;documents created by a potential donor, but also documents received from other &#xD;&#xA;individuals or organizations associated with the donor’s activities.  Examples of these &#xD;&#xA;documents include: &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;• Essays, examinations, course notes and thesis research created while a student &#xD;&#xA;• Lecture notes, course outlines, reading lists, class lists, examination questions, &#xD;&#xA;students’ papers, letters of reference and other correspondence that document &#xD;&#xA;a teaching career &#xD;&#xA;• Original manuscripts and typescripts of publications, and correspondence with &#xD;&#xA;co-authors, readers, and publishers &#xD;&#xA;• Correspondence, minutes of meetings, reports and other documents related to &#xD;&#xA;membership in professional organizations &#xD;&#xA;• Diaries, journals and correspondence involving family, friends and associates &#xD;&#xA;involved with personal interests &#xD;&#xA;• Photographs documenting family, university career and professional activities &#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;University records generated in an individual’s capacity as an administrator (for &#xD;&#xA;example a dean, committee chair, or administrative officer) should be transferred to &#xD;&#xA;Archives and Special Collections by the office in which they were generated.  Not all &#xD;&#xA;departments and faculties, however, make transfers on a regular basis, so university &#xD;&#xA;records are dealt with on a case-by-case basis if found among the personal papers of &#xD;&#xA;donors.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hope this helps!

Academic libraries get their operating funds from their campuses, and their institution's faculty and students are their closest and most primary clientele. (Though of course not the only one.) It's extremely difficult to make a long term and wide view case for the greater good when there are everyday immediate research and teaching needs standing in your building, sending you emails, and accessing articles through your big deal subscriptions. On a daily basis, academic libraries and their directors are answerable more directly to their campus administration rather than to their profession. It takes some very strong leadership, both at the library and the campus level to be able to look beyond these more immediate needs in a systematic way. There's some of that out there, but not enough of it yet to have achieved the kind of coordination that would be necessary to make what Gowers is calling for a reality." />

We love working together and I don't see anyone at my branch who's a non-professional. We're all pros, simple as that. As the local tech guy, I wind up teaching the staff about tech and computer things like changes to the ILS, eBooks, and stuff like that. The thing to note is that I teach this stuff to everyone, including Pages. Why? Because I have two people who are now Library Assistants who stated as Pages. We like to &quot;grow our own&quot; people and one of the best ways to do that is to give everyone the information. When they get promoted or go on to a different branch, they've got some knowledge and skills that make them stand out from those who don't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I hold one on one training sessions with anyone who wants them. Doesn't matter what they want to learn, I'll teach them. A few days ago one of my Pages came to me and asked how to search the ILS for specific books. As a Page, she really doesn't need to do that because Pages aren't working the desk or helping people with specific book queries. But as a staff member for a public library, at the very least she wanted to know how to find books for herself. So I showed her. Does it fall within her job description to know that stuff? No. Will it help her move up if she decides to be something other than a Page? Absolutely. Isn't that what professional development is for?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And finally, on the system level. Whenever there's a training that comes up, no matter what it is; something big at the Carnegie downtown, might be some informal session at Admin, or an all hands thing at the branch EVERYONE can go. We'll note it on the yearly evaluation that they've had training and education above and beyond and we explain to them that this kind of thing helps when other positions open up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It boils down to this. We're a library, and we believe in sharing information, no matter what the relation is to someone's job description. After all, knowing how to do X and Y when no one else in the interviews knows how to do it makes a real difference!" />

The full-time library assistant is a member of the state library association and attends the annual conference with the librarians. She also attends workshops in the area on Interlibrary loans (which she is in charge of), and copyright since she works with reserves. We receive a monthly list of free webinars from the state library association that the library assistant may register for as she sees fit. The library assistant participates in annual faculty readings and all library training. Perhaps this seems excessive to some? Since we are a small library, we wear many hats and cross-train so that we can help each other as the need arises. The training, development and supervisory experience (of student workers) as well as time on the reference desk are helpful in moving into librarian jobs, as three of four of the last assistants have gone on to library school." />

Are you a library assistant who would like his library to develop a program or are you a manager who wants to know how to develop library assistants to their full potential? I will try to answer from both sides, having sat on both sides in the last few years.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As the HR person for a library, I have to consider the needs of the library first when I hire. We try to keep a mix of part-time and full-time positions to allow for scheduling flexibility. The cost of benefits is also a concern - when your personnel budget exceeds a certain percentage of your overall budget, you become vulnerable to fluctuations in income (if our sales tax income drops, I might be forced to lay people off, and that is not something I ever want to have to do).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A third consideration is succession planning. Whenever we have a job opening, we start by looking at current staff job descriptions and what hats can be shifted from person to person so that each person's job gradually becomes a better match for his skills and interests. Then we advertise for someone with the skill set we are lacking. When I hire I am always looking for people who have skills beyond what I have asked for, and particularly in areas I know we are weak, even if those tasks aren't currently being hired for. I look for management interest/potential, because a lot of people I interview are not inclined toward an administrative future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the library does pay for some conference and workshop attendance, we expect that people with a professional degree should take primary responsibility for their own professional development. I expect the librarians on staff to do professional reading and to bring ideas and concerns to the table. I expect that they will contribute to projects as they are being developed, that they will apply their particular talents whenever the opportunity arises, and that they will also volunteer to do some of the grunt work when that's what is needed. I expect that they will find ways within our organization to continually hone their skills. I expect a cheerful disposition and exceptional customer service skills.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When we have a position open, it is sometimes an opportunity for a part-time person to become a full-time person (I should state here that we currently do not have library assistant positions - we hire part-time librarians and their job title is librarian - budget concerns may cause us to to shift from this in the future). If creating a full-time position is in the best interest of the library, that position is offered to a staff person who has talents we need, who has demonstrated initiative and leadership, who has embraced his or her work at the library, and who has expressed an interest in working full-time. If it includes management responsibilities, we will usually post the job and invite current employees to apply.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some realities from the HR side of libraries:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Often libraries can only afford library assistants, and folks with&#xD;&#xA;   library degrees apply for and take those positions. As the HR person,&#xD;&#xA;   if I offer a non-degreed position, and people with degrees apply,&#xD;&#xA;   chances are I will hire a person with a degree.  &#xD;&#xA; - I get a lot of applicants when I post a full-time position and relatively few for&#xD;&#xA;   part-time positions. If you can afford to work part-time, the system&#xD;&#xA;   is to your benefit. If you can afford to hire full-time, you get a lot more applicants to choose from. &#xD;&#xA; - If you are trying to break into the library world&#xD;&#xA;   and can find a job in a small library (they usually    pay less,&#xD;&#xA;   alas), you will get to build your resume faster with a    greater&#xD;&#xA;   variety of skills.&#xD;&#xA; - The library will never be as focused on you as you are.You are in the best position to direct your own career. Be proactive. Do things that get you noticed, make your interests known, and above all, be amazing when you are dealing with library visitors, staff, and volunteers (these are your best references)." />

Supposedly I teach this stuff...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Classification systems like DDC exist to accomplish two major goals:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - placing books (or other physical items) near others similar to them, in an overarching organization scheme&#xD;&#xA; - putting a unique label (known as a &quot;call number&quot;) on each book in a library so that given that label, a would-be reader can find exactly that book&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DDC classifies books by their main subject -- what each book is about. To make it possible to classify any book that might come into the library, a classification system has to encompass as much of the total universe of knowledge as libraries generally hold -- which is a large universe!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DDC was designed by 19th-century American Melville Dewey, and is used to organize the nonfiction shelves in most American public libraries. (You may have noticed that much fiction in American libraries doesn't use DDC; instead, it's often arranged by genre -- romance, mystery, speculative fiction -- and author.) If you think the way Dewey split up the knowledge universe:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - 000 – Computer science, information and general works&#xD;&#xA; - 100 – Philosophy and psychology&#xD;&#xA; - 200 – Religion&#xD;&#xA; - 300 – Social sciences&#xD;&#xA; - 400 – Language&#xD;&#xA; - 500 – Science (including mathematics)&#xD;&#xA; - 600 – Technology and applied science&#xD;&#xA; - 700 – Arts and recreation&#xD;&#xA; - 800 – Literature&#xD;&#xA; - 900 – History and geography&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;is a trifle odd, you're not alone! It's a reflection of Dewey's 19th-century educated-gentleman sensibilities (well, except for &quot;computer science,&quot; which is obviously a later addition), and things have changed a good bit since then. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When a new book comes into the library, a librarian whose specialty is cataloging skims the book to determine what it is about, then looks that subject up in a Dewey &quot;schedule&quot; (actually some rather thick books or a complex website) to work out what its Dewey call number should be. Once labeled with that number, the book goes to a shelf near neighbors on the same or a similar subject. Catalogers in different libraries may make different decisions about where to classify a book, depending on their sense of where the book best fits with the local library's collection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The trademarks and other intellectual property associated with DDC [belong to OCLC, Inc.][1], which publishes revised Dewey schedules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.oclc.org/dewey/about/licensing/default.htm" />

One of the reasons for the lack thereof is probably because it's quite uninteresting (at the moment).

These remarks are not meant to be an official statement for the Library of Congress, but are merely the reflections of a software developer who has worked on the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;LC currently [receives](http://blog.gnip.com/gnip-partners-libraryofcongress/) the Twitter data from a third party data provider Gnip. Gnip packages up each hour's tweet and delete activity using [BagIt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt), which is [tarred up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)), and made available on [Amazon S3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3). The structure of an example bag looks like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;2012050105&#xD;&#xA;|-- bagit.txt&#xD;&#xA;|-- data&#xD;&#xA;|   |-- 2012050105_deletes.gz&#xD;&#xA;|   `-- 2012050105_tweets.gz&#xD;&#xA;`-- manifest-sha1.txt&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A simple custom Python/Django application at the Library of Congress periodically polls S3 for new bags to download. When it finds a new one it downloads the tar file, untars it, counts the number of tweets and deletes, verifies the bag, and uses an internal data transfer application to inventory and copy the bag to archival storage, after which the bag is deleted from the local filesystem. This process runs 24/7 in order to keep up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tweet and delete data look like the JSON that the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/show/%3Aid) itself emits. We have made no effort (to date) to normalize the data using another format for several reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. LC has received 94 billion tweets so far, and are currently receiving (on average) 13,750,000 tweets per-hour...and the rate is still increasing. It would require a significant amount of computing power (more than a budgetary and policy constraints currently allow for) to re-process this data.&#xD;&#xA;1. When researchers are given access to the data it is likely that they will already be familiar with the Twitter JSON format and its documentation, so reformatting it into something else will likely get in the way.&#xD;&#xA;1. In the interests of the archival principle of [original order](http://www.archivists.org/glossary/term_details.asp?DefinitionKey=69) it seems wise to archive the data that we receive, since it seems closest to capturing the essence of a tweet.&#xD;&#xA;1. Like you, it isn't clear to me what format would be better than the Tweet JSON and why.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this brief on-the-ground description of the Twitter archiving activity provides some guidance, and doesn't do a disservice to any of the folks at LC that have been involved in the effort." />

Using the [CREW Method][1], for example, you have a strong, consistent process in place.  The act of reviewing &amp; weeding feeds naturally into the act of acquisition (see page 10 of their manual).  The weeding is dictated by a number of relevant factors, many of which folks list above: condition, circulation stats, relevancy, availability elsewhere (not just ILL but classics that can be found on Project Gutenberg).  Using this method as the basis for your policy, you have strong arguments for not just weeding, but weeding with collection management in mind.

One of the reasons for the lack thereof is probably because it's quite uninteresting (at the moment). In the interests of transparency I can provide some rudimentary information about how the data is archived, as I have been involved in the little bit of software development LC has done around the Twitter data to date. These remarks are not meant to be an official statement from the Library of Congress, but are merely the reflections of a software developer who has worked on the project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;LC currently [receives](http://blog.gnip.com/gnip-partners-libraryofcongress/) the Twitter data from a third party data provider Gnip. Gnip packages up each hour's tweet and delete activity using [BagIt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt), which is [tarred up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(file_format)), and made available on [Amazon S3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3). The structure of an example bag looks like:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;2012050105&#xD;&#xA;|-- bag-info.txt&#xD;&#xA;|-- bagit.txt&#xD;&#xA;|-- data&#xD;&#xA;|   |-- 2012050105_deletes.gz&#xD;&#xA;|   `-- 2012050105_tweets.gz&#xD;&#xA;|-- manifest-md5.txt&#xD;&#xA;`-- manifest-sha1.txt&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A simple custom Python/Django application at the Library of Congress periodically polls S3 for new bags to download. When it finds a new one it downloads the tar file, untars it, counts the number of tweets and deletes, verifies the bag, and uses an internal data transfer application to inventory and copy the bag to archival storage, after which the bag is deleted from the local filesystem. This process runs 24/7 in order to keep up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tweet and delete data look like the JSON that the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/show/%3Aid) itself emits. We have made no effort (to date) to normalize the data using another format for several reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. LC has received 94 billion tweets so far, and are currently receiving (on average) 13,750,000 tweets per-hour...and the rate is still increasing. It would require a significant amount of computing power (more than the current budgetary and policy constraints currently allow for) to re-process this data.&#xD;&#xA;1. When researchers are given access to the data it is likely that they will already be familiar with the Twitter JSON format and its documentation, so reformatting it into something else will likely get in the way of understanding.&#xD;&#xA;1. In the interests of the archival principle of [original order](http://www.archivists.org/glossary/term_details.asp?DefinitionKey=69) it seems wise to archive the data that we receive, since it seems closest to capturing the essence and context of a tweet.&#xD;&#xA;1. Like you, it isn't clear to me what format would be better than the Tweet JSON and why.&#xD;&#xA;1. JSON itself is unversioned, and [according to its creator](http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/computing-conversations/-/blogs/discovering-javascript-object-notation-with-douglas-crockford), will not change...ever. This is kinda nice, in theory, for preservation purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this brief on-the-ground description of the Twitter archiving activity provides some guidance, and doesn't do a disservice to any of the folks at LC that have been involved in the effort." />

There is no device I am aware of that allows the eReader app to simply remove the book when the loan has expired. The eBook will show some kind of indication that the loan period is expired and if the user tries to open it they will get some form of error message that tells them they no longer have access to the book.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All the eBook apps that I'm aware of do *not* remove the eBook from your device because of security concerns. If an app has the power to erase something from a device, then it presents an exploit that could be used to damage data on the device. So to be on the safe side, the app makers do not have that kind of access built into their software. The apps can download and store, but they cannot remove. (At least not automatically, the user has to initiate the deletion.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's another service that kind of competes with OverDrive called [Freading][1]. We use it here at my library system and it's another method of providing eBooks for our patrons. Freading is different from OverDrive in several ways but the big two are the fact that Freading doesn't really have much from the big six publishers and how Freading does downloads.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See, with Freading, you get an allotment of tokens per week. The tokens are virtual of course but they allow you to download a limit of books per week. Here, we have four tokens per patron. Each eBook is a set number of tokens. Some are one, some are four, but you get the idea. You can download one four-token book (checks out for two weeks just like OverDrive) or you could download four one-token books. The library is paying Freading by the download so, unlike OverDrive, the eBooks are always available. No holds, no waiting, no out of stock like you see with OverDrive which has a model that's much more like a &quot;traditional&quot; library collection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Freading uses Adobe Digital Editions for authentication and they have apps for iOS and Android. However any eReader app using ADE will work with Freading too and even Freading recommends the BlueFire reader for iOS or Android. Like OverDrive, it's a two week check out and the item simply will not open after the loan period has expired. The user can remove the eBook from their device, but the app will *not* do it for them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another difference between OverDrive and Freading is the renewal process. While neither of these services has a renewal mechanism built in, the patron can simply re-download the book from Freading at a whim if they didn't finish. With OverDrive, if the book is popular, and there's a waiting list, then that person will have to wait to finish it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://freading.com/index" />

One can also access Twitter API but then everyone stores his archive in different formats so there is no easy way to exchange and combine archived messages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand there is interest in analyzing microblogging and tweets are analyzed by companies and researchers. But are there open and standard tools to collect, archive, and analyze tweets? And which collections of archived microblogs exists in addition to the LoC? I don't want to propagate &quot;MARC for Twitter&quot; but at least something more precise than &quot;just use CSV/JSON&quot;. Relying on the custom format of one particular provider (Twitter) at one particular point in time does not look like a reliable solution for long term archiving.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**P.S:** Ed Summers gave a brief overview of the format used by LoC for archiving Twitter. There are some open questions how do use the format for other services (e.g. [Google+](https://developers.google.com/+/api/latest/) and for particular selections of messages (somehow documented in `bag-info.txt`). I'd like to see tools to create your own archives in the same format - for instance all tweets by some user accounts or all tweets with a given hashtag like #VenusTransit in a given time - and tools to read and analyze these archive files. There are several closed web applications to do so but they don't provide import/export in such a defined standard format, do they?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The safety of children left alone in a library building is a serious concern of the library staff.  The responsibility for the safety and behavior of children in the library rests with the parent/caregiver and not with the library personnel.  Library employees cannot be responsible for children who are unattended or demonstrating inappropriate behavior.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Parents are responsible for the conduct of minor children (under 16 years of age) in the library or on library grounds, regardless of whether they are with their children or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No child age ten (10) or younger may be left unattended in any area of the library.  Children up to age 10 years of age and younger must be supervised by a caregiver at least  12 years old who is able to attend to the child’s safety and ensure appropriate behavior.  A child up to age 10 or younger who is attending a library program need not be accompanied in that program by a parent/caretaker, unless otherwise indicated.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Children up to age 6 must have a parent/caregiver in the immediate vicinity of and in visual contact with the child.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Children of any age who require special supervision shall be accompanied by a parent/caregiver at all times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The use of the children’s area is for children and teens through 17 years of age.  For the safety of all children, adults (18 and over) who are not accompanied by a child, are to use the children’s area only for the purpose of retrieving materials for check out or to make arrangements to pull materials for research to be used in other areas of the library.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The use of the teen area is for teens in 6th-12th grades only.  For the safety of teens, adults older than this or children younger than this are not allowed in the room unless retrieving materials for checkout.  Parents wanting to use the internet with their teens are asked to use the computers in either the children’s area or at [the computer lab area.]&#xD;&#xA;" />

Second time, warned that if you did not stop you'd be asked to leave if it happened again.  Third time, you are asked to leave for the rest of the day.  Tomorrow?

When the first request of a patron could not be fulfilled, the patron replied with a photo of the front page of the magazine in question - he had it in his hands some time ago and was by now desperately searching for an article he remembered reading to reference it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;With the help of another colleague it was determined that the title was of Ukrainian origin, and several attempts were made to transcribe the title from its original Cyrillic script. Eventually one of those transcriptions took hold on one of the search engines fed, and further refinements on the title could be made which made it possible to trace down that the magazine, while in Ukrainian, was actually printed and published in Toronto.&#xD;&#xA;From there it was routine work to find three copies existing within Europe, and initiate an ILL loan on one of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The key to searching in this case was the variety on transcriptions/romanizations of the Cyrillic title. Even with two Russian-speaking librarians cooperating on the challenge, it took several attempts to find the title hidden in the latin-scripted databases and weed out all the false positives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, apart from the excellent tips math_librarian already mentioned in his answer, I'd add that you might ask a native experienced with transcriptions (and their possible variations) to aid in finding references to the original that could in turn lead you to a possible translation." />

It's important to be prepared - think ahead of how to deal with different possibilities. The Black Belt Librarian books are a great resource. We also started keeping a record of incidents on a staff wiki, so everyone would be aware (very helpful for those who are part-time and might not know of specific patrons or incidents). A few hours of role-playing can give everyone a good feeling of confidence. We also use instant messaging among the staff so we can communicate without being obvious, and that has been very helpful in alerting co-workers that a situation might be developing, and can be diffused early.

The [International Society for Knowledge Organization][2] (ISKO) should provide some references, but my personal impression is that ISKO somehow lost touch to the technical development during the 1990s. For recent research in knowledge organization I better recommend the [Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services group][3] (NKOS). Within the field of information science, knowledge organization has lost importance with the rise of information retrieval and the shift from documentation science to information science.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Classifications are just one kind of the systems, which knowledge organization deals with. Despite the long tradition of classification systems, I found that knowledge about these systems is often low and practical application is poor. For instance one should know about basic terms such as facet, precombination, and postcombination, instead of the simplified image of a classification as a tree. In theory, revision and evaluation should be applied regularly to classifications. In practice some libraries even fail to cleanly track classification changes and to create a simple histogram or tree-map with distribution of their holdings in the classification. One reason is the lack of availability of the classification system in a machine-readable form. For instance the [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) ontology better fits to thesauri than to specialized classification systems and many classifications are hidden in proprietary library systems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Maybe someone else can suggest a good textbook are best practice guide to work with classifications.

Children up to age 10 years of age and younger must be supervised by a caregiver at least  12 years old who is able to attend to the child’s safety and ensure appropriate behavior.  A child up to age 10 or younger who is attending a library program need not be accompanied in that program by a parent/caretaker, unless otherwise indicated.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Children up to age 6 must have a parent/caregiver in the immediate vicinity of and in visual contact with the child.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Children of any age who require special supervision shall be accompanied by a parent/caregiver at all times.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The use of the children’s area is for children and teens through 17 years of age.  For the safety of all children, adults (18 and over) who are not accompanied by a child, are to use the children’s area only for the purpose of retrieving materials for check out or to make arrangements to pull materials for research to be used in other areas of the library.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The use of the teen area is for teens in 6th-12th grades only.  For the safety of teens, adults older than this or children younger than this are not allowed in the room unless retrieving materials for checkout.  Parents wanting to use the internet with their teens are asked to use the computers in either the children’s area or at [the computer lab area.]&#xD;&#xA;" />

I suppose they get stuck hunting for a book and use it to recheck the catalogue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have asked this question in various channels, so far all I see is presentations on qrcodes in libraries, no statistics presented.

I actually wrote a short science fiction story about almost exactly this subject. It was about how the library was going to catalogue a book about the history of a settlement on Mars. Since it was the first such book written about the first settlement and written by a human Martian, they needed to open up a catalogue classification for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the DDC is indeed a rigid classification system [there is a place in the history section reserved for extraterrestrial worlds][1]. (The title of my story was *999.9*.) So there are parts of the DDC that are currently unassigned that could be used for such discoveries. Whether Melvil himself did that, well, I doubt it. Somehow I don't see him looking towards the stars and pondering intelligent life in the universe. Either way, those at the LC and OCLC have designated room to place new things if and when they're discovered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for LCSH and Deweyless classification schemes, that's much easier. They can just add a new subject heading and call it something that makes sense. Since most Deweyless classification schemes are based off BISAC, then the publishers would get together, add a new heading like &quot;SCIENCE - LIFE SCIENCE - EUROPAEAN&quot; and call it a day. I'm sure the LC would do something similar, but there'd be some kind of committee meeting, debate over the name of the heading, and a final vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes#900-999_.E2.80.93_History.2C_geography.2C_.28.26_biography.29" />

This amount was usually the retail cost of the item (because in a scenario where we might later have to replace the item, we cannot be assured of any discounts we might have gotten on the original purchase) plus a processing fee (as material processing adds value to the collection in terms of retrievability and longevity). While using retail numbers may seem to inflate the actual replacement costs for the specific materials (which may be replaced at a discounted rate), the actual value of a collection exceeds the value of the individual items in that it is a *collection* - carefully selected to be current and to cover a wide range of topics and interests - so on balance, this warrants the use of the retail price. Obviously, with prices stored in the catalog record, the total value is easily calculated by a summation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of this ignores the fact that a collection only has value if the public it serves finds it useful. A collection that is not circulating well may be out-of-date or out-of-touch. If your health collection in a public library has only books from the last 5 years, it is valuable. If the materials are 10 years and older, it is worthless. To truly understand the value of your collection then, you can't look at replacement cost and ignore what your circulation rates are telling you.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Often, libraries establish a threshold to which patrons can no longer check-out more materials. The same is true for lost or overdue materials.

However, by blocking all access, the library will encourage the patron to return materials or pay down his fine. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is it worth it to block access, is the practice successful, or will you just never see the patron again?

They often resort to using other people's cards and are not really affected by our policy of restricted access above $10 in fines. Or they disappear from the library altogether and cease being invested in what we're offering. I believe that, if this method is used to induce patrons to return items, the threshold should be significantly higher than our $10 or the $15 mentioned elsewhere. If a patron has $50 in lost or overdue items, then it's probably worth the library's while to block them from computer access and use a collection agency to go after the money. This would enable people who don't have a *serious* problem returning items to continue using some of the resources that the library provides. And if the worry is that they will continue to check out and lose/not return items, they could be restricted from borrowing additional items but still allowed to use the public computers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bottom line: Not allowing them to use the computers probably hurts them a lot more than it helps us." />

Facebook's age policy says users [must be 13 or older][1]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, my question: If a library plans to use Facebook to connect with teens -- for example, using a Facebook group for teen volunteers, or a Facebook page directed at teen users -- and we know that targeting teens often attracts tweens, should the library somehow address Facebook's age policy? If so, how? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Possible points and situations to consider:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - A FB group is a great place to share info with select teens (like a Teen Council). Given that these teens may be in an official library role (registered volunteers or members of a library program such as Teen Council) do we/should we have any responsibility when the younger members join the FB group?&#xD;&#xA; - If we actively target teens on FB, is it incumbent upon us to point out FB's age limit (and if so, where/how?) or expect patrons to inform themselves? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - As partners in helping guardians find the info they need to make decisions for their families, do we provide [info about the FB age limit][2]? &#xD;&#xA; - Does anyone have a helpful policy (or established practice) along these lines?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=210644045634222&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.facebook.com/help/parents" />

With the right know-how, your sys admin can create indexes for pretty much any MARC record field.  For the most part, Horizon indexes are divided into two different kinds: Browse and Keyword.  With a few exceptions, such as ISBN, there is no such thing as an &quot;Exact&quot; search.  If you are wanting to search multiple indexes at a time, you have to use keyword searches.  You can't combine browse searches together. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;BASIC SEARCH (and options):&#xD;&#xA;There are a couple of different ways to do more advanced searches in Horizon.  From your basic search, by pressing F2, you have access to all the browse, keyword, and exact indexes that have been setup in your search profile, which may not be all the indexes available (this is something your sys admin controls).  From here you can search one field at a time.  However, you can also add a &quot;restriction&quot; by clicking the &quot;restrict&quot; button.  The restrictions are based on item, not bib, information and thus do not correspond to the MARC record.  These are all setup by your sys admin but there may be some defaults.  We have the ability to restricted to &quot;checked in&quot; status, specific collection codes, and locations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you get your initial results, if you used a keyword index such as the &quot;General Keyword&quot; that returns titles, versus authority records, you'll also have the ability to &quot;limit&quot; your results further.  This is done by clicking the &quot;limit&quot; box on the bottom of the results page.  Limits can be tricky to use unless you understand the back-end cataloging.  They are based on the MARC record so you must use MARC codes when appropriate.  For example, if you wish to limit to English language titles, you need to put in the code &quot;eng&quot;.  Again, like everything else, the actual limit options you have are dependent on your sys admin.  Also, limits and indexes in Horizon are really stupid.  They only search for exactly what you ask them to.  For instance, reading level is often put in as a range.  However, when you search for reading level, if you enter 8, it'll only find items that have 8 in the reading field and ignore those that should include 8 such as if it's entered as 7-10.  Limits can be used on top of each other so you could, for example, first limit to autobiographies and then limit further based on number of pages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;EXPERT SEARCH:&#xD;&#xA;The expert search is the easiest way to do multi-field searches.  You get to it by opening the basic search and then clicking the &quot;Command Mode&quot; button on the top right.  Scroll through your index options and then double click on the first index you want to use.  It will appear down below in the search command section.  Here's an example of how our author keyword search looks:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;authkw: &gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;enter your search term after the colon:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;authkw: john grisham&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Horizon is case insensitive and keyword indexes don't care what order you put the terms in. HOWEVER, there is a bug in the 7.5+ version that will cause Horizon to report an error if you try to put a comma in the search term.  This was not a problem when we were on 7.3.4.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Arrow past the closing greater than sign and enter your Boolean term or click one of the operator buttons. Then double click the next index you want to use.  For instance, my final query might look something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;authkw: john grisham&gt; NOT &lt;subjkw: christmas&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you're finished creating it, hit the search button.  At this point, you can limit the results further if desired.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;MISC Notes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Horizon's Boolean operators are not case sensitive (unlike current versions of HIP).  As a result, when using keyword indexes be very careful to avoid using Boolean operator's such as NOT otherwise you may inadvertently exclude the titles you were looking for.  For example, if you used the title keyword index to search for &quot;Size 12 is not Fat&quot;, you should enter your query as &quot;Size 12 is Fat&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;* The asterisk is a wild card character in Horizon and HIP. &#xD;&#xA;* Avoid punctuation marks in your query, particularly exclamation points and question marks.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are the keyword indexes we have in our install:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Author Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* General Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* Subject Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* Title Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* Age Level Keyword (I believe this was custom)&#xD;&#xA;* Name Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* Publisher Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* Reading Level Keyword (I believe this was custom)&#xD;&#xA;* Serial Title Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* Series Keyword&#xD;&#xA;* Spanish Title Keyword&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are the limit options we have:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* All authors&#xD;&#xA;* Awards note&#xD;&#xA;* BK--Biography&#xD;&#xA;* BK--form of item&#xD;&#xA;* Edition&#xD;&#xA;* Edition - Unabridged Audiobook&#xD;&#xA;* Format Limits&#xD;&#xA;* Genre&#xD;&#xA;* Imprint&#xD;&#xA;* Language Codes&#xD;&#xA;* Medium (gmd)&#xD;&#xA;* MPAA Ratings&#xD;&#xA;* Physical Description&#xD;&#xA;* Publisher Date&#xD;&#xA;* Publisher&#xD;&#xA;* Series&#xD;&#xA;* Series number&#xD;&#xA;* Subject&#xD;&#xA;* Target Audience&#xD;&#xA;* Title&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a lot more detail that I could go into but hopefully this covers the basics of your question.  If you or your Horizon sys admin want more information on setting up the indexes, I highly recommend subscribing to the Horizon-L listserv (I think you have to sign up on SirsiDynix's website).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Just to clarify, when I say &quot;Horizon&quot; I mean the staff search side and when I say &quot;HIP&quot; (Horizon Information Portal) I mean the patron side." />

Because we lose access to older books, it can't be relied on to support older technology.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because of this model, I've just been buying fewer of the in-depth books in general.

It does mean that you'll probably want to supplement your library-school education with a few programming courses on the side; I generally recommend the local community college. You may be able to crosslist a straight-up programming course or two from comp sci, but I'm not always sold on how well-taught or practical such courses are.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alternately, if you're interested in systems administration, a certification or two in Linux and/or database administration would be a fine idea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, I caution HEAVILY against the laundry-list approach to skills development that your question hints at. Picking up a disconnected laundry-list of half-learned skills might get you your first job, but it won't help you deal with what comes at you that's unfamiliar (and something always will!), and it won't help you with the constant skills acquisition that all technologists do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Try doing (or helping with) projects, or apprenticing yourself to someone who does work you're interested in, instead of focusing so hard on that laundry-list.

For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I work in a public library. The circulations staff can manually check out materials if you provide an ID that they can use to look up your account by name and address. (Address is important; even in a small suburb, there will be some overlap between names!) If someone has moved, they presumably know their former address and we can go through the process of updating that information as well. Most people don't want to go through this process, though; it's much, much quicker to use a self-checkout machine! The thing is, the machine can't read and interpret every ID in the world. Instead, a physical card with a barcode on it suffices to identify you to the machine. In theory, some of the machines could even read a photo of the barcode on your smartphone, but the library would still need to issue you that original exemplar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A large national library is going to have lots of readers from all over. Many will have similar names, may move between visits, may be from countries with unfamiliar IDs, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. It's much easier (and more secure) to have a uniform photo ID that all the employees understand to represent you and your specific privileges at that library.

The change from AACR2 to RDA? Well, there's several answers to this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The change in the National Authority File will be March 31, 2013. There will be some headings in the NAF that are still AACR2 and will need manual clean up, but the vast majority of headings will be &quot;RDA compliant&quot; and will require no maintenance. All new authority headings added to the NAF from April 1, 2013 on MUST be RDA headings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Library of Congress is going one step further, and switching ALL cataloging to RDA on the same timeline. They are currently in process of training all their catalogers so they will be ready for the March 2013 deadline. The training materials are available for free here: http://www.loc.gov/catworkshop/RDA%20training%20materials/index.html Information on LC's RDA plans is here: http://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When asked at ALA, *most* libraries intend on making the change from AACR2 to RDA cataloging in the same time frame, as in the first quarter (or half) of 2013.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Information from the PCC (Program for Cooperative Cataloging, aka BIBCO/CONSER/NACO/SACO) on implementation can be found on the PCC website: http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/rda/RDA%20Implementation.html  There is no &quot;hard and fast&quot; deadline for the switch. It's anticipated that once libraries start switching (and several libraries that participated in the test have continued to catalog in RDA so it's already started) it will have a snowball effect and more and more libraries will switch to RDA.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*How is this going to affect the millions of MARC records currently in AACR2 rules?* Short answer: it's NOT. RDA was written so that AACR2 records will NOT have to be re-cataloged. AACR2 and RDA are perfectly capable of playing nice with each other and living side by side.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, there are task groups working on the idea of &quot;hybrid&quot; AACR2/RDA records to fully utilize the benefits of RDA. The goal is to enhance the AACR2 records, without affecting their bibliographic integrity. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of changing cataloging rules from AACR2 to RDA?* Things like relationships in RDA are where the &quot;real&quot; benefits live. It's a step towards linked data. One of the biggest differences is just the way you *think* about a resource when you describe it. But we are currently prevented from fully utilizing RDA by the limits of MARC. I second Dorothea's recommendations to read/listen to Karen Coyle and others on this topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The change from MARC to whatever comes next (the Bibliographic Framework initiative http://www.loc.gov/marc/transition/ ) will have a whole different impact and hopefully we'll be able to fully utilize the benefits of RDA.

Every item in a collection should be justifiable, according to selection criteria already in place, so it shouldn't take a large committee to defend, but having an item challenged can feel like a personal attack and having a supervisor's support is imperative. Libraries of all types should have procedures in place to handle this sort of situation; this document would outline who is involved. Often it will include a governing board (library board of directors, school board, etc) and may outline the various levels of review and how the process is elevated to the next level when not resolved. Having a procedure in place helps keep things objective, but can leave room for compromise if necessary." />

At our library, whenever a material is returned with damage of any kind we contact the last person who had it and discuss it with him. If we have to leave a message, we temporarily block the account so he has to contact us in order to continue using the library. Sometimes the person will offer a plausible explanation of non-responsibility (usually, the book was that way when he got it), so we thank him for his help and then just put a note on the account in case it develops into a pattern. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We had a member who was hand &quot;deckling&quot; the edges of some of our books. We had a suspect, so we pulled some of the other items the person had checked out recently and we found other &quot;deckling.&quot; It could be that the suspect just liked the same authors as the deckler, so we were careful not to accuse outright when we called. If a book is returned with writing, you can start with the person who returned it last and then look at some of the other items she checked out recently to see if there is a pattern. If you there is no pattern and you feel it is inappropriate to ask about it because too much time has elapsed, you can still put a note in the account in case it happens again." />

Another group has candidates give presentations and invites everyone to give feedback. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In either case, the candidates meet with a LOT of people -- potential departmental colleagues (both librarians and support staff), the search committee itself, others outside the department who are invited to have a discussion, faculty members, supervisors, the University librarian... Candidates talk to at least 30 people in the course of the day, and I think that's good, if exhausting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think the most valuable parts of interviews I've participated in (as an interviewee and as a search committee member) are the dinner the night before with selected members of the search committee and the time alone with the direct supervisor and the supervisor's supervisor, if applicable.

The video chip requires your operating system to have a compatible software driver.

If you want to be involved with software development, you should take some introductory computer science courses that really focus on the hows and whys, rather than &quot;if you write this line of code, it will do this thing&quot;.  Knowing more generic things like object-oriented programming are more important than knowing Java, for example.  If you want to be involved with system administration, learn how to work in a unix-like environment.  Install a &quot;hard&quot; linux distribution like Gentoo on your computer (or if you have one, a spare), where you're pretty much forced to learn how to manipulate the system without a GUI.  Most of your server access is going to be via command line, and that's generally the best way I've found for forcing yourself to learn it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Really, though, being willing and able to think, deduce logically, work through a process, and learn is much more important than the technology." />

However, when I am trying to develop a part of the collection, one thing I do is look to see what other libraries have:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Go to the World Catalog and do an advanced search&#xD;&#xA;   ([http://www.worldcat.org/advancedsearch/][1]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Search for *dd:004** as a keyword, and limit your publication dates&#xD;&#xA;   (maybe 2010-2012) and your format (books). This will give you all the&#xD;&#xA;   books with Dewey Decimal classification in the 004s published since&#xD;&#xA;   2010 sorted by relevance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Scroll through to see what looks like it would be appropriate for&#xD;&#xA;   your community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Repeat for the 005s and the 006s to see the rest of the computer stuff.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You can sort by date if you want to see what is newest or limit&#xD;&#xA;   yourself to just 2012.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You can add other keywords if you want to see something in particular&#xD;&#xA;   (like *iPad* or *networks*).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - You can also add more digits to your *dd:* search to narrow your&#xD;&#xA;   results (*dd:005.13** will give you books on programming languages,&#xD;&#xA;   for example).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have access to FirstSearch (another interface for searching the World Catalog which requires a password), you can sort by number of libraries rather than relevance. I do not know what algorithm OCLC uses to establish relevance, but a list sorted by relevance is similar to the one sorted by number of libraries, so number of libraries is part of the equation. I think the open version rolls multiple editions of a title into one record.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This trick will work for other areas of Dewey Decimal of course, but note that your *dd:* input must be at least 3 digits. So searching for *dd:33** will **not** give you all of economics. And if you leave off the asterisk, you will not get results that are cataloged with digits behind the decimal (so *dd:005* will only give you items with exactly 005 in the record, where *dd:005** will give you 005, 005.1, 005.74, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are in acquisitions, your jobber probably also has helpful lists. For example, we order most of our books from Ingram, and I can see a list of the top 200 books for the past year for Dewey 000s (or the top 50 for the last quarter). I can also browse by BISAC category or Dewey number sorted by publication date (not a testament to the quality, though sometimes reviews or review citations are available in the item record). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.worldcat.org/advancedsearch/" />

It looks like until the 19th century it was common to just refer to &quot;the recent results&quot; instead of citing a list of specific articles with author, title, journal, pages etc. Citation styles are usual no later than [the 1960s](http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=citation+style&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=3), the introduction of citation analysis by Eugene Garfield may also have had an impact. I guess that formal citations got obligatory during the early 20th century, but when and how?" />

We utilize thematic displays and individual easels spaced throughout the collection. Thematic displays are usually topical and will include as wide a variety of items as possible. A gardening display will have everything from container gardening to planning a landscape, and it might have DVDs, books, magazines, and flyers for an upcoming program. While it is always rewarding when someone takes an item from a display, it is especially rewarding when someone excitedly tells you they didn't know you had ... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of a display is to get the viewer to slow down and engage, and perhaps find something new. It is essential that the items on display be attractive. Poorly circulating books generally make poor displays. We increased the circulation of our kids' nonfiction section by 22% this past year largely by putting books on easels throughout the area. Now kids can easily find the dinosaur books, the truck books, the animal books, Garfield, etc. Those displays empty out faster than any others in the library, but it isn't just the display books that are going. Once a kid has found where you hide the Lego books, they will often check out every one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am disinclined to do displays that are political or controversial. A favorite book display in some libraries is the annual banned book display, and I have to say it is one I do not favor. First of all, the books were rarely banned, they were only challenged and perhaps removed from a single library here or there. More than this, the underlying message is that we want to alert the public that someone somewhere wanted them not to be able to read these books. It says to people that banning or challenging books is bad. The truth is, whether or not we would ever consider the removal of a book from our library (since we follow a defensible collection policy), we welcome challenges - we may not enjoy them, and we don't want to deal with a new one every week, but we do want to know what the people in our community are worried about. Additionally, I think this display advertises to people that there may be materials in the collection of which they would disapprove. While we welcome challenges, we don't want to spend a lot of time on challenges for materials that people would not have ever picked up had we not waved the materials at them." />

I am very good at boring people with 'digital preservation/curation/stewardship' terminology, so I can at least speak from experience on this one. I'm also jaded and think that the terminology is to be avoided INSIDE the library/archives community (see longer answer). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To answer your question directly, the terms used for describing the digital preservation activity should reflect the vocabulary of your client. My advice is to avoid using curation, stewardship &amp; preservation in the noun sense and if you must, slip them in to your conversation as verbs. Talk about what you do, not about the systems and frameworks and theories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are trying to &quot;sell&quot; someone on digital preservation (specifically, DP) set the stage and explain what digital preservation does, not what it is. Ok, here is my example (longwinded) elevator pitch; critique at will:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;The problem is that digital media is not stable--it has a shelf life just like anything else. The bits of a digital file have a physical representation somewhere, like your hard drive or a disk array. We can't just let this stuff sit, or it will go bad eventually. They call that bit-rot. It's a real thing! Think about all those AOL cds floating around from the 90s. Do you think they are all readable today? So just like grocery stores have insanely complex inventory systems for managing the shelf life of food stores, libraries and archives have to come up with strategies to manage stores of digital data. But digital data has a couple advantages which sometimes make us forget that it is not a stable media. You can create immediate and exact duplications of data, you can nearly instantaneously transfer data, you can transmute data from one kind to another, and more than one person can hold the same data on their e-reader at a time. These are the primary reasons that redundancy has become an industry standard for digitally preserving our information; but redundancy is only the foundation of a data preservation strategy! Digital media has a host of threats that digital preservation strategies can help mitigate... here's my card.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Longer Answer**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(This is something I've been keeping around for a some-day paper, but I'll share here. Realizing this is not a discussion board, email me critiques at collie@msu.edu if you wish)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DiMaggio and Powell (1983) provide the answer as to why we have such ambiguous and unsexy terminology in this &quot;new&quot; field of &quot;digital curation/preservation/stewardship.&quot; In essence, I think the language we promote intentionally obscures function and efficiency. Because a large portion of the digital curation community has grown out of libraries and archives in a time of transition and intense professional insecurity--we've attempted to adopt the values and culture we see around us. This is called mimetic isomorphism and is dangerous because we can become overly reliant on conformity in an attempt to dispel uncertainty and gain legitimacy in the face of our peers. A tightly knit community of practice centered around niche conferences with very few journals makes mimetic isomorphism common as we attempt to adopt the best-practices passed down from our senior members--the successful pioneers! Some justification here is that acceptance of widespread isomorphism likely stems from a structural perspective that equate standardization with the alignment of technology and transactions (Bolman &amp; Deal, 2008) a concept well affirmed in the digital curation literature under the banner of interoperability &amp; best practices, etc. DiMaggio and Powell suggest that imitation is concentrated in projects with high degrees of uncertainty, especially as concerns technology--we see this as institutional repositories compromise tangible functions in place of a better presentation of functionality (aka the :smoke and mirrors repository&quot;). Indeed of late there has been a surge of pilot projects that espouse to comply with architectural frameworks (e.g. OAIS, TRAC) seemingly before deploying tested infrastructure or reaching consensus on difficult enterprise-level policy decisions. Futher, new curricular programs and new conferences continue to normalize cohorts with the shared values and practices (including a specialized language) which again, threatens to entrench us through heavy cultural assimilation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

On the one hand, the forensic disks seem to be more in keeping with not changing the object and in a sense with the ideals of original order.

Text="At the [UK Web Archive][1] we store our 56TB of data on HDFS, where each block is replicated three times giving ~170TB in total. We use the default HDFS data scanning frequency of three weeks, i.e. every block on every node is checked once every three weeks. For comparison, [this best practice page][2] indicates that weekly-to-monthly fixity checking (a.k.a. 'scrubbing') is recommended for ZFS.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, as @paul-wheatley says, it's a trade off between risk of (multiple) failures versus the cost of checking the data, and thus controlled by the time between fixity checks. This also has consequences for your choice of storage architecture - high latency storage (e.g. tapes on shelves) is difficult to scan effectively compared to a HD cluster with plenty of CPU time per TB.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**UPDATE:** I should point out that my answer only applies to the routine fixity checking that is used to ensure that stable resources are unchanged. Further fixity checks can and should be performed when data is copied, moved or rearranged. HDFS can only ensure the data has not changed since it was added to HDFS. The process of moving data into or around HDFS requires its own workflow-level checks to ensure that the data has been transferred correctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.solarisinternals.com/wiki/index.php/ZFS_Best_Practices_Guide#Storage_Pools" />

David Rosenthal does a fantastic job breaking down the costs of digital storage in a number of posts on his blog (e.g. http://blog.dshr.org/2012/05/lets-just-keep-everything-forever-in.html) In short, although the price per gigabyte will continue falling, we will produce data at a faster rate. Therefore, digital repositories that commit to saving everything will have to commit increasing amounts of their budgets to purchasing storage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Ethics: As Trevor said in his questions, most donors have little idea that deleted files remain on their disks until they are over written. Even when they are overwritten, because of the way computer storage works, traces of deleted files can remain in the slack space. I would argue most donors are not agreeing to give files that they had deleted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Archivists work with shelf-space and budget constraints. They also discard portions of accessions during processing and restrict access to other parts. I don't imagine these practices will disappear with mature born-digital archives. Logical images should be the norm in digital archives.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Forensic images might appear to offer the advantage of better representing the original workflow, but with the random writes, defrags, and rewrites of modern storage hardware, I wonder how useful that might be." />

The problem is that the different parts of the stack change at different speeds. You generally want your backend store to change very slowly, so you know the data you've got is safe. Your ingest processes tend to be big phases of development followed by long phases of maintenance and use. Your access systems tend to need to change more rapidly and constantly, as you react to your users' needs.

Whenever possible, it is obviously wise to produce PDFs that conform to an ISO standard!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because Adobe can't resist cramming more bells and whistles into the format, though, it's eminently possible and quite common to produce non-standards-compliant PDFs. I offer a list of potential preservation risks in such PDFs, with the understanding that any given PDF may incur all, some, or none of them:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Multimedia risk**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Embedding multimedia (audio, video) in PDFs is usually a bad idea. Should the embedded multimedia format become obsolescent, you'll have to can-open the PDF to yank it out and migrate it, afterwards trying to reconstitute the PDF. Complex objects are generally easier to preserve when different media types are kept in separate files (as with most HTML-based web pages).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Font-loss risk**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you don't embed fonts in your PDF, glyphs in those fonts may display wrongly or not at all on computers that don't have that font loaded. Over time, entire fonts can be lost or become unusable on modern equipment; I've heard from electronic thesis and dissertation managers that ETDs without fonts embedded have indeed suffered loss of information content.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Text non-computability risk**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Scanning a print book page to PDF does not create computable text; it creates a picture of text. This is a common example of non-computable (non-indexable, non-searchable, non-text-minable, non-copy-and-pastable) digital &quot;text,&quot; though hardly the only one. Some word-processing and page-layout programs produce PDFs in which (for example) the page layout is incorrectly hinted such that trying to copy-and-paste across two columns of text produces sentence salad! Hyphenation and page breaks also distort text for purposes of indexing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Overzealous security risk**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many software packages that produce PDFs offer various kinds of &quot;security measures&quot; such as passworded file access or restricted printing. As with any technique that intentionally distorts or restricts access to files, such measures pose a *serious* risk to preservation. Do not use them on a PDF you hope to preserve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Loss of text-structure risk**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Computers are very good at producing nice typography, much less good at interpreting it. If the structure of a text (section divisions, headings, lists, etc) is important information, PDF is a poor choice to preserve that text, since (unless very carefully produced) it destroys structural information, retaining only appearance information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Conversely, if text *appearance* is vital, XML is usually a ridiculous preservation choice.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Bad configuration risk**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;PDF is one of those million-option formats! Choosing software and PDF-production configuration poorly incurs any number of information-loss risks, from inappropriately low-resolution images to lost fonts to OS dependence to... you name it, really.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.pdf-tools.com/pdf/pdf-iso-standards-pdfa-pdfx.aspx&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.adobe.com/bg/products/acrobat/standards.html" />

The core PDF format is based on a subset of [PostScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript), which is a programming language designed to produce graphics, and common graphics formats, but over time the format was expanded to allow streams to contain any type of data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The PDF format is very complicated and pulls in several other complex specifications. In practice, the vast majority of PDF files were only validated by testing whether Adobe Acrobat can display them as intended and it is quite common to have PDF encoders generate output which breaks the standard in ways which Acrobat tolerates, leaving the problem to be detected only when the file is first used with other tools.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. While the subset of PostScript supported in PDF is not as capable as full PostScript (fortunately, as the latter which is (Turing Complete)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness], it is still the case that what you actually have is executable program code and thus the only way to display PDF content is to execute each PostScript command in order:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        /Times findfont 100 scalefont setfont&#xD;&#xA;        10 10 moveto&#xD;&#xA;        .5 .5 .5 setrgbcolor&#xD;&#xA;        (Hello World) true charpath fill&#xD;&#xA;        showpage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   This fragment uses only a subset of the language exposes the key areas of concern for simple PDF display:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   1. Since this is program code, implementation details can affect the output. As a simple, hopefully purely hypothetical example, consider how processor or compiler-specific differences in [floating-point rounding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems) could affect a complex document after many operations cause display problems such as lines which are supposed to appear joined to have visible space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      As the full language is far more complicated than the subset above, there&#xD;&#xA;      are many variations on this theme. Fortunately the mainstream&#xD;&#xA;      implementations have generally converged on reliable inter-operability&#xD;&#xA;      but you are still likely to need a copy of Acrobat if you receive content&#xD;&#xA;      from a wide range of sources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      This was particularly a problem in the past with older “print to PDF” drivers which simply took the raw PostScript which they would have sent directly to a printer and wrapped in a PDF container.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   2. Font choices are specified by name. The corresponding font file may be embedded within the PDF file but as system fonts are also supported, it's quite easy for authors to use special fonts and forget to embed them until the first time the PDF is opened on a system which does not have those fonts installed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      We've seen this somewhat frequently with academic journal articles which&#xD;&#xA;      were created using [LaTex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and use its fonts to display mathematical symbols. A Google search confirms that this is not an uncommon mistake as it will only be a problem when documents circulate outside the significant portion of scientific users who have the LaTeX fonts installed: https://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Cannot+find+or+create+the+font%22&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      Additionally, the [TrueType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType) and particularly [OpenType](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType) font formats are by necessity quite complex to deal with the range of human writing systems. Again, this is an area of potentially significant difference between implementations and, particularly for [complex scripts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_script) like [Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic) or  [Devangari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari), the failures can potentially lead to the text being incorrect. Fonts are versioned, so it's possible to have text which would be displayed correctly if the operating system's version of a font is used instead of the embedded version or vice versa. The more obscure the languages you work with, the more you need to have some sort of system to check for correctness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. For simple images, PDF writers are allowed to use &#xD;&#xA;   [a number of encodings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Raster_images) and over the years various image formats have been added, all of which have require full software support:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Adobe.27s_versions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Over the years, Adobe has also added many other types of rich content: audio, video, 3D imagery, etc. All of these include the full set of challenges for preserving their respective formats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Primarily for business users, Adobe has added several types of [interactive forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Interactive_elements), which rely on several complicated specifications and have in my experience been far less supported by third-party implementations, particularly the open-source community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. In PDF 1.2, support was added for [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) as part of the forms specification. Since JavaScript is a full programming language, this means that the only way to process those actions is requires executing code in a manner consistent with the original implementation. Fortunately, this is likely to be uncommon in most preservation scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7. The specification includes varying levels of encryption. It is possible to&#xD;&#xA;   [brute-force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) weak passwords and the older encryption algorithms but that might be possible and the software to do so might be difficult or illegal to obtain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In practice, many of the concerns are manageable with several precautions. If possible, the best place to start is by requiring the restricted subsets of PDF which have been developed to avoid many of these issues: [PDF/A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A) and [PDF/X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/X) both ban the more hazardous features and dramatically simplify the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I would consider having a program which audits various features:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. All fonts in the file are the standard core PDF fonts or embedded within the file.&#xD;&#xA;2. All images use a non-deprecated encoding, are in the subset of format which you are prepared to support, and decode without errors.&#xD;&#xA;3. All content streams are checked against a whitelist of supported types&#xD;&#xA;4. The PDF is unencrypted or at least that the password is known and the file decrypts successfully" />

The core PDF format is based on a subset of [PostScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript), which is a programming language designed to produce graphics, and common graphics formats, but over time the format was expanded to allow streams to contain any type of data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The PDF format is very complicated and pulls in several other complex specifications. In practice, the vast majority of PDF files were only validated by testing whether Adobe Acrobat can display them as intended and it is quite common to have PDF encoders generate output which breaks the standard in ways which Acrobat tolerates, leaving the problem to be detected only when the file is first used with other tools.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. While the subset of PostScript supported in PDF is not as capable as full PostScript (fortunately, as the latter which is [Turing Complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness)), it is still the case that what you actually have is executable program code and thus the only way to display PDF content is to execute each PostScript command in order:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;        /Times findfont 100 scalefont setfont&#xD;&#xA;        10 10 moveto&#xD;&#xA;        .5 .5 .5 setrgbcolor&#xD;&#xA;        (Hello World) true charpath fill&#xD;&#xA;        showpage&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   This fragment uses only a subset of the language exposes the key areas of concern for simple PDF display:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   1. Since this is program code, implementation details can affect the output. As a simple, hopefully purely hypothetical example, consider how processor or compiler-specific differences in [floating-point rounding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems) could affect a complex document after many operations cause display problems such as lines which are supposed to appear joined to have visible space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      As the full language is far more complicated than the subset above, there&#xD;&#xA;      are many variations on this theme. Fortunately the mainstream&#xD;&#xA;      implementations have generally converged on reliable inter-operability&#xD;&#xA;      but you are still likely to need a copy of Acrobat if you receive content&#xD;&#xA;      from a wide range of sources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      This was particularly a problem in the past with older “print to PDF” drivers which simply took the raw PostScript which they would have sent directly to a printer and wrapped in a PDF container.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   2. Font choices are specified by name. The corresponding font file may be embedded within the PDF file but as system fonts are also supported, it's quite easy for authors to use special fonts and forget to embed them until the first time the PDF is opened on a system which does not have those fonts installed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;      We've seen this somewhat frequently with academic journal articles which&#xD;&#xA;      were created using [LaTex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and use its fonts to display mathematical symbols.

Again, this is an area of potentially significant difference between implementations and, particularly for [complex scripts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_script) like [Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic) or  [Devangari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari), the failures can potentially lead to the text being incorrect. Fonts are versioned, so it's possible to have text which would be displayed correctly if the operating system's version of a font is used instead of the embedded version or vice versa. The more obscure the languages you work with, the more you need to have some sort of system to check for correctness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. For simple images, PDF writers are allowed to use &#xD;&#xA;   [a number of encodings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Raster_images) and over the years various image formats have been added, all of which have require full software support:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Adobe.27s_versions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Over the years, Adobe has also added many other types of rich content: audio, video, 3D imagery, etc. All of these include the full set of challenges for preserving their respective formats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. Primarily for business users, Adobe has added several types of [interactive forms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Interactive_elements), which rely on several complicated specifications and have in my experience been far less supported by third-party implementations, particularly the open-source community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;6. In PDF 1.2, support was added for [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) as part of the forms specification. Since JavaScript is a full programming language, this means that the only way to process those actions is requires executing code in a manner consistent with the original implementation.

If possible, the best place to start is by requiring the restricted subsets of PDF which have been developed to avoid many of these issues: [PDF/A](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A) and [PDF/X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/X) both ban the more hazardous features and dramatically simplify the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beyond that, I would consider having a program which audits various features:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

Since most Deweyless classification schemes are based off BISAC, then the publishers would get together, add a new heading like &quot;SCIENCE - LIFE SCIENCE - EUROPAEAN&quot; and call it a day. I'm sure the LC would do something similar, but there'd be some kind of committee meeting, debate over the name of the heading, and a final vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes#900-999_.E2.80.93_History.2C_geography.2C_.28.26_biography.29" />

In the future, we plan to simplify the grammars&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and try to unify them.

Ok, here is my example (longwinded) elevator pitch; critique at will:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;The problem is that digital media is not stable--it has a shelf life just like anything else. The bits of a digital file have a physical representation somewhere, like your hard drive or a disk array. We can't just let this stuff sit, or it will go bad eventually. They call that bit-rot. It's a real thing! Think about all those AOL cds floating around from the 90s. Do you think they are all readable today? So just like grocery stores have insanely complex inventory systems for managing the shelf life of food stores, libraries and archives have to come up with strategies to manage stores of digital data. But digital data has a couple advantages which sometimes make us forget that it is not a stable media. You can create immediate and exact duplications of data, you can nearly instantaneously transfer data, you can transmute data from one kind to another, and more than one person can hold the same data on their e-reader at a time. These are the primary reasons that redundancy has become an industry standard for digitally preserving our information; but redundancy is only the foundation of a data preservation strategy! Digital media has a host of threats that digital preservation strategies can help mitigate... here's my card.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

These could be linked together in time by their `created` attribute. But I get the sense that you are talking about versioning in a different way, similar to how it is talked about in revision control systems? The answer to Mark's question is important. Do you want to version the metadata about the object, or the objects themselves? If the latter I think you can probably bend mets:fileGrp to your will. If the former, perhaps you need a new METS document that is linked somehow to the previous one, via the identifier?

Authenticity in archival terms means that the archive is responsible for the object still remaining &quot;what it purports to be&quot; AFTER it has entered the archive - if it was a fake to start with, this is not the archive's problem, but it needs to be protected from falsifications of any kind while it is within the archive itself. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course digital archivists I have worked with have tried to transfer this notion to digital objects, this is just an example but a good one because it builds on OAIS:  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/storage/datastores/papers/Auth_Prov_CamReady_sent.pdf&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;In a general way, I find very interesting for this discussion the notion of artifactual value:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_artifactual_value&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will post again if I find anything more conclusive.

Authenticity and how to ensure it is maintained across time is a crucial question for the archivist and not just for those who deal with digital records. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The definition given in a previous reply here is the basic one most archivists use but to expand it somewhat I think authenticity involves other record characteristics of reliability (ie. it is what it says it is), integrity (ie. it is complete and unaltered) and useability (ie. the record can be retrieved and understood). Assuring these things means that the record is authentic and will remain so. Note that this does not mean the digital record must always be maintained in the original format in which it was ingested into a digital archive, and it is particularly important to note that authenticity is not saying anything about the truthfulness, trustworthiness and veracity of the contents of the record, only that it is what is was said by its creators to be and was created by them in the context and at the time they say it was. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There was some a lot of good archivally-based work done on authenticity and digital records by the InterPARES project at the University of British Columbia (http://www.interpares.org/) and the project published a lot of documents about the outcomes of the research. Look particularly at InterPARES 3 which was specifically addressing digital preservation and authenticity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the context of digital preservation ensuring authenticity is not straightforward. In my experience it involves making sure all the recordkeeping and contextual (provenance etc) metadata is tied in some way to the record for as long as it is in the archival system (can be part of the record, can be in a database but permanently linked to the record), ensuring that there are rigorous controls on access to the records, ensuring that there are no unauthorised or unseen changes to the bit level integrity of the record (its fixity), and, critically, keeping a record of everything that is done to the record as it journeys through the OAIS.&#xD;&#xA;" />

If libraries had to keep every bequest of a library-lover, we'd drown in ancient duplicate National Geographics. It's just not on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unless a willed collection contains extremely rare or valuable books, any kind of bequest with &quot;you must keep this collection intact&quot; strings attached would be declined -- and even one containing such paragon books would only be accepted with a heavy sigh. Shelf space is neither free nor infinite. Cataloging is expensive. Current, popular, quality books tailored to the library's patron base should not be crowded out by books that are none of those things but came with a legal obligation attached.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the normal course of things, a bequest of books would be winnowed for no-hopers by gifts/acquisitions librarians, then the remainder scrutinized by the library's collection developers, who would make a per-book keep-or-toss decision (where &quot;toss&quot; might well mean &quot;sell,&quot; for a book with monetary value but little use-value to the local patron base). Books that duplicate the library's existing collection will typically be kept only if demand warrants an extra copy or if the bequest copy is in better condition than the library's copy, in which case it would likely replace it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For non-duplicate books, the chances of an additional &quot;loaner copy&quot; being purchased are minimal to zero, though digitization may be a possibility if the condition and copyright status of the book permit. Ranganathan's First Law of Library Science: *Books are for use.* Not for sentiment, not for display alone, *use*. If nobody's going to use it, most libraries won't keep it. (The exception is research libraries, whose mission includes perpetual access to the scholarly record -- and even they are starting to do this work consortially rather than individually.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If a book is legitimately rare or otherwise valuable, an academic or research library will generally route it to the Special Collections department, where it will receive a heightened level of care and security (which, alas, often means somewhat lessened access; I'll let special-collections librarians elaborate on this). Since special-collections departments have subject specialties, some book-trading goes on among them; a rare book may hop to a library where it fits better with what else is in special collections. Some public libraries or their consortia may have special collections, but most will sell such books on, knowing themselves less in need of them and unable to care for them properly." />

If the donor may not want material to circulate, or may not want parts of the collection to be made available before a certain date, you should capture and implement those policies. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if the works are non-circulating, you may be able to provide and present a catalog of the collection (maybe by creating a special location for holdings records?)   If many or most of the works are in the public domain, or are licensed to you and your patrons, you can recreate the collections digitally (LibraryThing did this for the collections of people like Thomas Jefferson). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some or many case you may be able to make copies for preservation purposes - see 17 USC 108 for the library/archive exemptions to copyright. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the items are of high value, then you should prepare them for conservation, and keep them in a climate controlled room.

The challenge with this is that while it is a very cheap alternative, real effort needs to be made to make sure that this data doesn't get lost in your organization and that its management is systematic and rigorous.

As for the encoding, I don't know, but I'd try UTF-8 first, and if that doesn't work (you get weird glitches on letters with diacritics), then try MARC-8. It is the responsibility of the importer to figure out what kind of data they are using, since the various standards don't provide any way to decisively identify format and encoding (supposedly encoding is indicated in the record, but that is accurate only 50% of the time, which means you are better off just choosing one, trying it, and switching if you don't like the result).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Koha handles MARC records natively so you don't need any sort of spreadsheet with mappings.

This may in turn enable relatively insecure (read: &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;cloud&quot;) infrastructure to be used for the preservation of highly sensitive materials.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Encryption doubles as an authenticity check, and in fact, some&#xD;&#xA;encryption methods involve the creation of a digital signature that can&#xD;&#xA;be used for provenance or bit rot detection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Encryption causes file size bloat to the tune of 20-30%.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* For light archives, encryption imparts a performance penalty for systems that need to extract the content from the preservation archive for access purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Another re-iteration: long-term secure preservation of the encryption keys themselves is typically raised as a legitimate concern. Fundamentally this problem is the result of two conflicting requirements: that the encryption keys be held by as few entities as possible to maintain their security, but also that they be easily acquired in disaster scenarios. I suggest that digital preservation repositories can mitigate (yet not fully eliminate) this concern by developing a management system for the encryption keys that leverages the technology frameworks (such as that for maintaining multiple copies with integrity checks) and policy frameworks (such as robust succession plans) that they ostensibly *should* have in place by virtue of being qualified digital preservation repositories. One can imagine an architecture, for example, where encryption keys are safely stored within the repository itself and encrypted using a Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme that would require the consensual participation of any seven of thirteen parties named in the succession plan in order to obtain them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not-cons: :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Personally, I don't buy the blanket argument that encryption increases the risk of bit rot because the argument assumes that the unencrypted form of the object is in fact resilient to single-bit error. I suggest that this risk be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and depending on the architecture of the repository, may represent no additional preservation risk. Moreover, I suspect that many if not most preservation repositories store content that is already sensitive to single-bit error by virtue of compression or the intrinsic nature of certain file formats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As with almost every other design aspect of digital preservation repositories, the use of encryption presents both utility and risk that should be carefully considered.&#xD;&#xA;" />

All public libraries in member states are included in the memberships) send two representatives (in my state, they are the heads of Youth Services for the state's library system) attend annual meetings and vote on themes, illustrators, vendors, and more.  Every individual who belongs has the opportunity to voice their ideas &amp; needs to their representatives, who bring these to the wider group.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The CSLP votes on the themes several years ahead of time in order to secure artwork, create manuals (with both rules &amp; regulations, particularly around copyright, as well as member-submitted suggestions for programs, crafts, contests, decorating, activities, reading lists and more), sort out vendors and otherwise organize it.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 2:&#xD;&#xA;No, you do not have to belong to CSLP to run a Summer Reading Club.  Libraries have run individual or regional summer reading programs they design &amp; execute themselves.  You do have to belong to CSLP to use the copyrighted artwork, however, and the other benefits outlined in answer to Question 3.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 3:&#xD;&#xA;As above, the copyrighted artwork is one benefit.  For example, children's illustrator Brian Lies created images &amp; posters to be used with the 2012 Children's theme.  You also receive the manual (passed out in CD form with the artwork on it where computers are common; in hole-punched binder-ready style for those without computers), there's an online forum, themed incentives &amp; decorations (the cost of which is much cheaper given the bulk numbers the size of the CSLP can pull in), and the time savings not having to come up with a unique theme every year.  In my state, the state library system provides some of the paper goods for free (subsidized by the state's sponsors, a state sport's team): posters, bookmarks, reading logs.  Oh, yes, and the CSLP comes up with related themes for Children, Teen &amp; Adult Services.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the benefits of not belonging or participating, you would have the ability to create your own theme (could be a pro if you like the creative freedom or don't like the theme the CSLP uses).  I'm also assuming that there would be some cost savings for the state if they didn't belong, but given the above benefits (to all public libraries within the state), it is unlikely that those savings outweigh the benefits.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.cslpreads.org/about.html" />

Finding the filing position in the shelflist.  Consult the class number&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  in the shelflist.  Find the proper location for the work being shelflisted.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  That is, determine where the work is to file according to standard&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  shelflisting practices.  In many cases, this will be in alphabetical order&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  by main entry or title.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2.  Cuttering for words.  After determining the filing position of the work,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; consider whether use of the following table to create the Cutter will&#xD;&#xA;&gt; achieve the proper position.  If so, use the table.  If not, complete the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cutter in order to fit in alphabetically with works already shelflisted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3.  Cuttering for numerals.  When Cuttering for Roman or Arabic numerals,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; use the Cutters .A12 - .A19.  However, if entries already in the shelflist&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have been assigned &quot;documents numbers&quot; (e.g. .A5 for the corporate heading&#xD;&#xA;&gt; United States. Dept. of ...) Cutter numerals to file directly after those&#xD;&#xA;&gt; entries.  Because of the infinite range of numbers, choose a Cutter toward&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the center of the available span when Cuttering for the first numeral in a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; class.  This will allow room for both smaller and larger numbers.  Follow&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this practice even with relatively low numbers since decimal fractions are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; filed in numeric order before the number 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Cutter Table&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When synthesizing a number follow the cutter table.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### After initial *vowels*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | b | d | l-m | n | p | r | s-t | u-y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+---+-----+---+---+---+-----+-----|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 2 | 3 |   4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |   8 |   9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### After initial letter *S*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | a | ch | e | h-i | m-p | t | u | w-y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+----+---+-----+-----+---+---+-----|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 2 |  3 | 4 |   5 |   6 | 7 | 8 |   9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### After initial letters *Qu*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | a | e | i | o | r | t | y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### For initial letters *Qa-Qt*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| use numbers | 2-29 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### After other initial *consonants*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | a | e | i | o | r | u | y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### For *expansion*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the letter: | a-d | e-h | i-l | m-o | p-s | t-v | w-z |&#xD;&#xA;|-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:     |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### Ambiguity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately as you can probably see from the table not all letters are&#xD;&#xA;explicitly listed out. And in addition with the expansion table, a range of&#xD;&#xA;numbers are listed which leaves some issues with creating the appropriate&#xD;&#xA;number.  In those case you then attempt to file in a way that will fit the&#xD;&#xA;item in alphabetically with works already cuttered. &#xD;&#xA;" />

If so, use the table.  If not, complete the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cutter in order to fit in alphabetically with works already shelflisted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3.  Cuttering for numerals.  When Cuttering for Roman or Arabic numerals,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; use the Cutters .A12 - .A19.  However, if entries already in the shelflist&#xD;&#xA;&gt; have been assigned &quot;documents numbers&quot; (e.g. .A5 for the corporate heading&#xD;&#xA;&gt; United States. Dept. of ...) Cutter numerals to file directly after those&#xD;&#xA;&gt; entries.  Because of the infinite range of numbers, choose a Cutter toward&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the center of the available span when Cuttering for the first numeral in a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; class.  This will allow room for both smaller and larger numbers.  Follow&#xD;&#xA;&gt; this practice even with relatively low numbers since decimal fractions are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; filed in numeric order before the number 1.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Cutter Table&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When synthesizing a number follow the cutter table.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### After initial *vowels*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | b | d | l-m | n | p | r | s-t | u-y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+---+-----+---+---+---+-----+-----|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 2 | 3 |   4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |   8 |   9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### After initial letter *S*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | a | ch | e | h-i | m-p | t | u | w-y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+----+---+-----+-----+---+---+-----|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 2 |  3 | 4 |   5 |   6 | 7 | 8 |   9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### After initial letters *Qu*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | a | e | i | o | r | t | y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### For initial letters *Qa-Qt*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| use numbers | 2-29 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### After other initial *consonants*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the second letter: | a | e | i | o | r | u | y |&#xD;&#xA;|------------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:            | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;### For *expansion*&#xD;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;| for the letter: | a-d | e-h | i-l | m-o | p-s | t-v | w-z |&#xD;&#xA;|-----------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----|&#xD;&#xA;| use number:     |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Synthesis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Example:  Reamde / Neal Stephenson&#xD;&#xA;    100 1# $a Stephenson, Neal.&#xD;&#xA;    245 10 $a Reamde / $c Neal Stephenson.&#xD;&#xA;    250 ## $a 1st ed.&#xD;&#xA;    260 ## $a New York : $b William Morrow, $c c2011.&#xD;&#xA;    300 ## $a 1044 p. ; $c 24 cm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Classification number for a 20th century American writer is *PS3569*.  &#xD;&#xA;   &lt;code&gt;050 #4 $a PS3569&lt;/code&gt;&#xD;&#xA;2. Instructions in the LC Classification Schedule for *PS3569* says: &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; The author number is determined by the second letter of the name  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Start with *T* &#xD;&#xA;  2. Second letter E. Look under *After other initial consonants*: E&#xD;&#xA;     maps to 4. Our cutter so far is *T4*.  &#xD;&#xA;  3. Expand one more letter for the third letter P. Look under *For the&#xD;&#xA;     expansion*: P maps to 7. Our cutter now is *T47*.&#xD;&#xA;  4. Extend out the cutter more using the expansion table if needed in order&#xD;&#xA;     to file within the existing shelflist. Going one more we have H which&#xD;&#xA;     maps to 4 making. Out cutter now is *T474* with a corresponding `050`&#xD;&#xA;     field of:  &#xD;&#xA;     &lt;code&gt;050 #4 $a PS3569.T474&lt;/code&gt;&#xD;&#xA;3. Looking at the [Library of Congress Record](http://lccn.loc.gov/2011020573)&#xD;&#xA;   we see however that the class number is something a bit different `050 ##&#xD;&#xA;   $a PS3569.T3868` This implies that this cutter was modified in order to fit&#xD;&#xA;   the names in the existing arrangement. Which is likely since many last&#xD;&#xA;   names begin with `S` and literary fiction is a fairly crowded part of the&#xD;&#xA;   shelflist.&#xD;&#xA;4. The call number is not complete however, there is a second cutter that the&#xD;&#xA;   instructions in the PS classification schedules (PS3550-3576) direct us to: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   &gt; Subarrange individual authors by Table P-PZ40 unless otherwise specified  &#xD;&#xA;   &gt; Including usually authors beginning to publish about 1950, flourishing&#xD;&#xA;   after 1960&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA;   Table P-PZ then in turn instructs the cutter to be created for separate&#xD;&#xA;   works, by the title of the work, filed between the cutters A61 and&#xD;&#xA;   Z458. Following our tables:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. First letter of Reamde is **R**.&#xD;&#xA;  2. Second letter is E. We look in the **After other initial consonants**&#xD;&#xA;     table: and see that E corresponds to 4. That makes our cutter so far&#xD;&#xA;     **R4**.&#xD;&#xA;  3. Third letter is A. We now look in the expansion table: See that A maps&#xD;&#xA;     to 3. That makes our cutter now: **R43**.&#xD;&#xA;  4. Usually we stop at the third letter (second number of the cutter). Most&#xD;&#xA;     authors are not prolific enough to justify needing to cutter out to a&#xD;&#xA;     third level. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   Note here that if you had a work like `245 10 $a Zodiac / $c Neal&#xD;&#xA;   Stephenson` that it would go in the same classification **PS3569.T3868**&#xD;&#xA;   but would then get cuttered differently by its title _Zodiac_. However, we&#xD;&#xA;   can not follow the synthesis rules since they would create a cutter of&#xD;&#xA;   *Z63* which does not fall in the permitted range for separate works that&#xD;&#xA;   the P-PZ40 table instructs us is between **A61** and **Z458**. In that case&#xD;&#xA;   we then would toss the tables out and then manually file the title starting&#xD;&#xA;   with **Z** but giving ourselves a bit of space in the advent we get another&#xD;&#xA;   work with a title that files after _Zodiac_.&#xD;&#xA;   &#xD;&#xA;### Ambiguity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately as you can probably see from the table not all letters are&#xD;&#xA;explicitly listed out. And in addition with the expansion table, a range of&#xD;&#xA;numbers are listed which leaves some issues with creating the appropriate&#xD;&#xA;number.  In those case you then attempt to file in a way that will fit the&#xD;&#xA;item in alphabetically with works already cuttered. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Note About Filing&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes libraries like filing. And they've got rules about them. They are&#xD;&#xA;extremely detailed. But generally we are filing on the first element of the&#xD;&#xA;string, in order to get an alphabetical arrangement. This is documented in the&#xD;&#xA;Library of Congress Filing Rules and the G100 instruction sheet&#xD;&#xA;[outdated version here](http://www.itsmarc.com/crs/mergedProjects/scmshelf/scmshelf/g_100_filing_rules_shelf.htm). Some&#xD;&#xA;important things to note when filing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* File as-is.&#xD;&#xA;* Ignore diactrics.&#xD;&#xA;* Ignore initial articles.&#xD;&#xA;* Hyphens break words.&#xD;&#xA;* Initialisms are complicated.&#xD;&#xA;* File titles until the end of the first significant punctuation {'.','/','('}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Education today /  1966  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Education today.    1966  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Education today /  by John Smith.  1969  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Education today.    1977  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Education today (Boston)    [serial]  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Education today--and how it works.  1970  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Education today : language teaching.  1966 &#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;* Numbers before letters&#xD;&#xA;* Ampersand is the only character that has a value. &#xD;&#xA;* Single surnames before compound surnames:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Ho, Chien Min  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Ho, Tien  &#xD;&#xA;    &gt; Ho Tang, Marsha  &#xD;&#xA;" />

The filesystem should perform this check *every* time a file is accessed, making it impossible to silently receive corrupted data. If your higher-level software doesn't provide this, it's almost certain that you'll eventually experience a problem where something is corrupted and accessed before an audit catches it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. The filesystems can perform data-integrity checks (&quot;scrubbing&quot;) in the background, often when the storage subsystem is otherwise idle, reducing the performance impact and need for periodic manual scans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Filesystem based checksums can be far more efficient for random I/O because they're stored at the block level rather than the entire file. This is usually not a major consideration but in some scenarios where only part of the file is read it can be a significant performance benefit while providing full integrity checks (e.g. reading file metadata, preserving large databases, or JPEG-2000s which are used for thumbnails far more often full decoded).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Note that while ZFS is the most famous option in this regard, [btrfs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs) and even NetApp's [WAFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_Anywhere_File_Layout) have some similar protections, albeit less thorough in the latter case)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not complete, however, as there are multiple other problems to be concerned with:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Higher level failures: e.g. if data is corrupted on the network, ZFS has no way of telling that the bits it methodically protected weren't actually the ones you wanted. Similarly, you can trust the bytes you read off of ZFS to be intact but you can't verify that they were received by a remote user unless you have some end to end checks (e.g. setting and validating HTTP Content-MD5 headers)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Human error: no filesystem protects against a human accidentally or intentionally overwriting a file, although snapshots can help at least in the former case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Replication: knowing that my bits are reliable still doesn't tell me whether you and I have the same file, or that I have a full and complete copy of a multi-file item. Something like a bag manifest is still necessary to address this and #1, and hopefully at least detect #2.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, while filesystem-level features like ZFS's send/receive can also be very handy for efficient replication, compatibility is a big concern if you're worried about the longevity of a particular platform.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One other category of software to consider would be something like [OpenStack's Swift](http://swift.openstack.org/) which provides similar characteristics - full integrity checks, automatic redundancy management, user-invisible scalability - but does so using any available filesystem by providing the checks at a higher level. As with something like ZFS, it's not a replacement for a higher-level repository system but it is an interesting choice for a foundation which solves a number of hard low-level problems so you can focus on the higher-level ones." />

Most libraries use barcodes because they are scannable, and when you order them, they are produced sequentially so that no number is accidentally used twice. You can create your own item stickers or your own barcodes even, if you have budget constraints - you just have to be careful about numbering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a typical ILS (integrated library system software), you have linked databases. The bibliographic database contains information about the material (MARC record fields with title, author, and other descriptors). The holding database contains information about individual copies and may contain fields like cost, call number, status, and circulation history. The two databases are linked by the material number field (the bibliographic databases allowing multiple material numbers to be associated with one record). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having unique material numbers allows you to identify which copy a patron has out, which is particularly at issue when an item is lost or damaged.

This facilitates replication.  Snapshots can be exported for remote archiving. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The big advantage of ZFS over storing a file checksum in a bag or database is that corruption is detected and repaired. The block/checksum hierarchy makes it easier to detect whether it is the checksum itself that is corrupted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An alternative to checksums and mirroring is to use a FEC type coding systems that can recover the correct signal  from corrupted symbols.

However, if your library stores the information, it could be required, by government authorities, to turn over the records it has.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Exactly how much circulation information is stored varies library by library.  The integrated library system (ILS) we use  provides a couple of different options.  We store everything the borrower has currently checked out.  Once the borrower checks that item in, it comes off their checkout record.  However, their name stays associated with the item record until the next borrower checks the item out (this is in case we discover the item was damaged or is missing a DVD, etc).  In addition, we have the option to store additional checkout history if we wished.  The version of Horizon we use provides the options to only keep the basic circ history (detailed above), provide an opt-in for individual patrons to keep their circulation history, or turn on circulation history collection for all patrons.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, we also have database backups.  So, while technically checkout information disappears from the patron records as soon as it gets checked in, in reality we do have a set number of days in backups that would contain additional checkout information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding who has access to this data:&#xD;&#xA;This tends to vary state by state.  ALA, the American Library Association, has a page that offers links to various state laws: http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/ifgroups/stateifcchairs/stateifcinaction/stateprivacy &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Colorado's statute is as followers:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Colorado Law 24-90-119. Privacy of user records. (1) Except as set forth in subsection (2) of this section, a publicly-supported library shall not disclose any record or other information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific materials or service or as otherwise having used the library. (2) Records may be disclosed in the following instances: (a) When necessary for the reasonable operation of the library; (b) Upon written consent of the user; (c) Pursuant to subpoena, upon court order, or where otherwise required by law; (d) To a custodial parent or legal guardian who has access to a minor's library card or its authorization number for the purpose of accessing by electronic means library records of the minor. (3) Any library official, employee, or volunteer who discloses information in violation of this section commits a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that even parents don't have access to their child's record unless they have their child's library card or number. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My understanding, and I'm not a lawyer, is that Federal laws don't say who can't access the record but rather who can.  One of the big debates within library circles for the past decade deals with the USA PATRIOT act. Basically, in certain circumstances it allows Federal authorities to have access to library records without a court order.

This means patrons are actively using a $10 part which is fairly sturdy and cheap to replace, rather than a direct port on a thin client that would mean eventually replacing a thin client.

The primary argument for me is the combination of two facts: as with other data software is brittle, requiring regular maintenance, and libraries are not generally major power brokers in the commercial software field. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Software companies have a strong incentive to build applications for as wide a market as possible, leaving libraries with very limited buying power, and as with other areas of preservation, decisions are made based on current market realities and whims. We've seen this with systems like Apple's QuickTime which had very complex functionality (e.g. embedded Flash &amp; other rich, programable content) added and later removed after falling into disfavor — certainly the right business decision and definitely a security benefit but completely stranding the small number of people with a significant investment in content which actually used those features.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At the other end of the market, a small vendor may go out of business or have key personnel retire, leaving all of their users stranded with no option other than hoping an alternative is available and that the migration path is not too rocky.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Open source software helps with several of these challenges:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. In the simplest case, it means that it's impossible for a vendor to simply disappear. It might not be cheap but at least you have the option of hiring a software developer to maintain or improve an open source application.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Corollary: you really want to make sure that you actually save a copy of the source for anything you use if the current maintainer starts to seem shaky.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. There's frequently a huge difference between a format as specified and as practiced. Using an entirely open-source stack now means that you have a known reference implementation from the beginning rather than finding out later that your data really only works well with one particular implementation. If you are forced to migrate later, it can be extremely helpful to have a known working codebase for reference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  On a related, open source software now almost always implies an open version control system which makes it much easier to determine where and how something stopped working. There's one other interesting aspect: the dominance of [distributed version control systems][1] in the open source world is particularly powerful because it breaks the assumption of a single privileged maintainer, making it safer for your organization to maintain local customizations against upstream releases. Handling local customization gracefully traditionally has been a weak point for commercial software vendors for various reasons but it's integral to working in the open source world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. There's a significant related advantage: open source software is usually considerably cheaper and you have cost saving options if you're not paying support but can perform some work in house – this is a benefit to the extent that it either frees budget for more direct preservation work and avoids unpleasant surprises down the road.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these generally shift as a function of how close they are to your critical path: if you need a particular viewer for a file format, it's far more important than, say, a search engine on your storage system since the latter operates independently and can be swapped out far more easily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This strongly rewards keeping your architecture simple and standard because you lower the chances that you'll need to start supporting something which has fallen out of popularity within the community. For example, storing items in a database is far riskier than storing the same content on a filesystem simply because it introduces a massive chunk of complex, possibly expensive, software which has to work simply so you can retrieve a file and the lack of a standard interface would mean that you need to develop or pay for support in anything which needs to access the data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control_system" />

Almost all open source software is the work of a community, and this community needs all specifications to be open, otherwise it can not work. There is no secret, whereas non-open-source companies usually have secrets that they use as a strategic advantage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Preference for [Open standards][1]**: When an open source software needs to store something or communicate over a network, it will use an open standard/protocol if one is available. Users of other software using the same standard can easily test and report incompatibities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Number of protocols supported**: Open source software tend to support more protocols/formats that their counterparts. For instance: Our company needed to import data from a specific rare format. The software did not support it, so we paid some company to implement it, and now it is part of the software. That would not happen with non-open-source software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard" />

I think at this moment that encryption is a useful and easy way to add one extra layer of protection, in the (rare) cases where this is felt necessary above the established level of security.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All security measures can lose their effectiveness over time, so all measures must be actively managed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is indeed a 'problem' of the management of the decryption keys. This problem should not be exaggerated. I have been looking for best practices for managing decryption keys, but up until now found no good reference for this. Any references welcome!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can offer these points for consideration:&#xD;&#xA;- the decryption keys should be stored in way that is technically and logically sufficiently separated from the storage of the corresponding files, so that an intruder who achieves access to the encrypted files is not likely to have access to the decryption keys. This is a very important point and should be considered carefully and repeatedly (external security audit?).&#xD;&#xA;- the decryption keys should never be transported together with the related encrypted files&#xD;&#xA;- storage of the decryption keys does not / should not have a higher level of security as  the storage of the encrypted files. The reason for this is that the organization is probably not familiar with higher levels of security, and higher levels of security introduce risks (too few people informed; unfamiliar technical solutions; no security audits because it is so little data)&#xD;&#xA;- don't use generic decryption keys which apply to a lot of files&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whether these suggestion really apply depends very much on the scenario you have in mind. At this moment I am thinking of a small number of selected files in our archive which are encrypted. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A completely different scenario would be an extra copy of all the files in our archive stored somewhere in the cloud, with all the files having the same decryption key. In this scenario it is not the problem of the management of decryption keys, but the management of this single one decryption key. Probably known only within a small circle of technical supporters. A loss of the key is no problem, as long as it is discovered soon. In that case the level of added data security because of the extra copy of all the files is lowered until a new copy is produced. The same goes for the account information and the passwords you need to access the extra copy. A seed based on the file name and path can help here. If you don't trust the cloud environment all encrypting and decrypting should take place in the original data environment." />

It's obviously a new Manifestation, but is it also a new Expression, or even a new Work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For fiction, those problems don't tend to be as prevalent; there may be some content added (eg, a new foreward that puts the novel into a different context), but you don't tend to have as significant wholesale changes.  You may have some differences in editions intended for different audiences, such as the [additional footnotes and section in the American version of *Good Omens*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens#Alterations_between_versions)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More typically, if there's something of this magnitude in a novel, it'd be in artwork, but this gets into other issues if the art was not part of the original book.  (then you have a Manifestation with more than one Work: the original story plus the new artwork).  I can think of at least [one case where this was reversed, and the artwork removed in *Stardust*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_(novel)#Publication_history).  In this case, we further complicate matters as the original publication was as a four part serial which was republished as a composite multiple times, then had the text portion stripped out which was also published in multiple forms.  (and then made into a movie, but movie adapations are generally considered to be new Works in FRBR; I also won't get into if it was a 'Composite Work' vs. a 'Composite Manifestation' for the initial collected work, but that issue of how to model composites I don't believe has really been solved).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And then we get into issues of translations.  Now, most people wouldn't consider the Spanish translation of a book originally in English to be a new 'edition' of a book, and many people model translations as a new Work ... but what do we do when there are multiple translations into the same language?  Should they be considered editions of each other, or as seperate but related entities?  For instance, we have classic poems such as Dante's *Inferno*, some translations that have attempted a [more accurate translation](http://www.amazon.com/Inferno-Signet-Classics-Dante-Alighieri/dp/0451531396) while others attempt to [maintain structure and rhyming](http://www.amazon.com/The-Inferno-Dante-Translation-Bilingual/dp/0374525315).  In a possibly more extreme case, we have  the bible; there was a fair bit of disagreement over the 2011 NIV translation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Where I've really seen the most problem isn't in books ... it's in movies.  All of the 'Deluxe Edition', 'Special Edition', 'Director's Cut', widescreen vs. pan &amp; scan, etc.  And then you work in VHS vs. DVD vs. BluRay vs. HD-DVD vs. laserdisc, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So ... with all of this said, I'd really suggest you follow Jakob's &amp; wdenton's advice, and look into existing systems.  It looks like oss4lib has handed off to [foss4lib](http://foss4lib.org/) for their list of open source library software; if you have more specific requirements, you can try asking on the [code4lib mailing list](http://dewey.library.nd.edu/mailing-lists/code4lib/)." />

It might have been the [Junius Henderson notebooks](http://www.mcn.edu/2012/extracting-data-historical-documents-crowdsourcing-annotations-wikisource), but to my knowledge, that was annotating the transcription and not working from images of the originals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In trying to find that poster and/or project, I came across [a list by Ben Brumfield of crowd sourcing transcription projects in early 2011](http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/2011/02/2010-year-of-crowdsourcing.html), and [his blog](http://manuscripttranscription.blogspot.com/) seems to be a great resource on the topic in general, but of note is that list is not all were successful:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; According to the New York Times article, there was an attempt to crowdsource the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. The article quotes project director Daniel Stowell explaining that nonacademic transcribers &quot;produced so many errors and gaps in the papers that 'we were spending more time and money correcting them as creating them from scratch.'&quot; The prototype transcription tool (created by NCSA at UIUC) has been abandoned.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;... I would assume that it would be possible to use the crowd source efforts to train an automated parser (train it on one page, then have it read the rest of the handwriting from that person), so that you can get the most productive use out of the volunteers ... but I don't know if anyone's doing it.  (or if it works as well in practice as in theory; I remember seeing an example from a war journal where the handwriting abrubtly changes due to an injury)&#xD;&#xA;" />

Rosetta and SDB/Preservica both allow administrators to restrict actions like ingest, preservation, and metadata editing to certain classes of users, and will record the ID of users that perform these actions. Restricting access increases the security of files and builds greater provenance. However, this feature is not as necessary for smaller organizations." />

As a result it is worthwhile to consider other points at which Libraries and Archives might benefit most from deciding upon their interaction/access strategy for their digital objects.&#xD;&#xA;If emulation were to be enacted as a long term access/interaction (I’ve substituted interaction for viewing here as I suspect that is what Trevor is more interested in) strategy then the next best time for the Library or Archive to decide to do this is likely to be before they accept items for transfer to the Library or Archive. Making the decision at that point enables a number of key steps to be included in the transfer process that will make enacting the emulation strategy much easier:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Intended rendering applications/environments can be identified via the transferring agency or donor.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Software licenses and binaries can be transferred to the Library or Archive.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Standard rendering/interaction environments (e.g. “all of government desktops”) can be snapshotted and moved to emulated hardware for use in interaction/access the objects that are to be transferred.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these steps are much more difficult and costly, or impossible at a later date.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**How late can a Library or Archive leave deciding what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The  answer to this question will depend on what the impact will be of a Library or Archive leaving their decision until very late. &#xD;&#xA;What might the *negative* consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xD;&#xA;If they were to use emulation as their strategy at that point then:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. they might struggle to know which software to emulate to use for interacting with the objects (i.e. they may not be able to ascertain what the intended interaction environment should be). &#xD;&#xA; 2. There may be no emulator available for the particular environment they want to emulate and:&#xD;&#xA;     a) No documentation left to enable them to create a new emulator for that environment&#xD;&#xA;     b) A significant cost may need to be incurred to create a new emulator for that environment&#xD;&#xA;     c)No documentation left to enable use of emulated environment and effective interaction with the object by non-specialists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What might the *positive* consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Tools to identify original creation environment and associated default interaction environment may have been created and developed to a point of high functionality.&#xD;&#xA; 2. [Emulation services][1] may be available at a low cost that are simple to use and inexpensive (e.g. submit the object and it is remotely emulated and provided for interaction via a browser or local app).&#xD;&#xA; 3. End-user software documentation may be available and integrated with emulation tools and services as a “help-layer” enabling easy use of old software by users who have moved on to new interaction paradigms. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The consequences of leaving such a decision to such a late point when using other strategies will be different. When deciding which strategy your Library or Archive will use it will be worth considering the consequences of the decision with respect to all possible choices. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Under what conditions should a library or archive choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy rather than an alternative?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a number of ways to answer this question. Firstly, a Library or Archive should always choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy when there are no feasible alternatives. When might that be the case?&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**At what point does emulation become the only option as a digital preservation strategy?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is potential for an emulation solution to become the only option for a Library or Archive to use as their interaction/access strategy for their digital content. Such a situation might arise if the following conditions are met:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. necessary interaction software still exists&#xD;&#xA; 2. an emulator to run the software exists or can be constructed and tested using original compatibility tests (for more information on how to know when to trust an emulation solution see [here][2].) &#xD;&#xA; 3. using original hardware and software is not an option&#xD;&#xA; 4. no alternative interaction or viewing tools are available such as migration/normalization tools). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many files have been created with structures that are not openly documented and for which the only tool available for interacting with or viewing the content captured in that structure is the original software.  In such cases, assuming the documentation outlining the way the software writes the files cannot be acquired, using the original hardware is not an option, and the original interaction software can be loaded into an emulated environment, then emulation will likely be the only option left  available. &#xD;&#xA;It may be possible to use reprogrammable hardware such as a [Field Programmable Gate Array][3] to [create the original hardware in programmable hardware][4]. But for all intents and purposes this is effectively another (potentially faster) version of emulation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**When should a Library or Archive choose emulation as their interaction/access strategy only for particular kinds of content and another strategy for other kinds of content?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital object interaction/access strategies that rely solely on emulation will never be appropriate for interacting with or accessing object content that involves a hardware component. In such cases, for example when replicating the full experience of a video game as played on a particular console, emulation alone will not be enough for accessing/interacting with the content. Replica hardware, such as game controllers, may need to be produced in order to maintain the full content experience. The advent of inexpensive microcomputers such as the [raspberry pi][5] and [inexpensive 3D printers][6] such as the [MakerBot][7] may make this option much more viable and prevalent in the near future. &#xD;&#xA;A migration strategy that is able to be tested and confirmed for every object it is used to access may be more practical in some circumstances for use as a viewing/interaction strategy. For example if processing a lot of simple objects that have few components to them migration may be more economical. Unfortunately most migration tools and processes currently do not incorporate comprehensive testing procedures and [anecdotal][8] [evidence][9] suggests that migration processes can often destroy content. In such cases the processes are effectively failing at adequately enabling viewing or interaction with the object as the object no longer exists in the same form post migration. &#xD;&#xA;Most good migration candidates are simple objects that often can still be accessed by current software such as text-based formats and simple images. As they can often still be accessed by current software there is a [question to be asked][10] as to why the Library or Archive would bother migrating them at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Under what circumstances would emulation be a preferable option to the alternatives for accessing or interacting with content?. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In almost all cases employing an emulation strategy for interacting with or viewing old digital content will be preferable than any alternatives. Emulation gives a richer, more [authentic][11] experience that can often evoke more emotion and feeling in the viewer than just seeing some raw data would. When coupled with options to enable the user to print the emulated content they are viewing, to copy text &amp; images from the object into a modern environment, to print the content to a file, or to use the original rendering software to create a new file based on the old file but using a different save-as parameter (e.g. from a .doc file to a .rtf), the emulation experience is often a much fuller and more gratifying experience than alternatives. &#xD;&#xA;When in a court of law in which digital evidence is being presented I would personally want to see the content that was presented using the original software, rather than seeing whatever content was left when the original file(s) was run through a migration process (i.e. see the actual content rather than manipulated/different content). I have blogged about this [here][12]. In fact this would be my preference in most if not all circumstances in which something important in my life hinged on some old digital content. Whether or not this is a widely held opinion still needs to be tested, however the Rules of the High Court of New Zealand were recently updated to include references to the need for preservation of “native electronic documents” when such objects are submitted as evidence. Native electronic documents or native file formats are defined as: “an electronic document stored in the original form in which it was created by a computer software program”. This may indicate a greater recognition of the need to enable access to/interaction with unaltered versions of digital objects. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Emulation may turn out to be cheaper and economically “fairer” than alternative options.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emulation may have two economic advantages over alternative methods:&#xD;&#xA;Once emulation services are in place the processes that Libraries or Archives need to implement if choosing an emulation strategy will likely be less onerous than alternatives. The essential steps for implementing an emulation strategy in such an organisation are to know what environments they need for interacting with all their digital objects and to make sure a service exists that provides that environment. The organisations can then choose which business model to operate under to enable access to/interaction with the objects. They might, for example, have a few workstations in their buildings for users to use at no cost for interacting with the objects. And/or they may have a limited set of remote-access licenses. In such cases the end-users would have an option for no-cost access to the objects but if they want to they could also pay for a remote service themselves. &#xD;&#xA;In addition to these optional business models and the low initial cost for Libraries and Archives, emulation tools services are likely to cost less to maintain over time. A single emulator can be used to maintain thousands of emulation environments (or more). The long term maintenance costs will relate to migrating the emulator to new host environments over time. To reduce this cost, initiatives such as [Dioscuri][13]  the modular emulator offer mechanisms for lowering this cost by removing the need to migrate much of the code base. Most importantly though, the cost of migrating the one emulator to enable the continued emulation of thousands of environments, which in turn enables continued access to millions/billions of digital objects, is likely to be much less than the cost to continually migrate each individual digital file over time. &#xD;&#xA;Furthermore with emulation you are always able to open objects structured with a particular format. With migration/normalisation you may have to decide how long you want to maintain a migration path for. So, for example, if in 100 years time someone comes to you with a WordStar 6 file that they found on a server of legacy objects, there may no longer be a migration path available for it. On the other hand, if emulation had been the chosen strategy for those files then they will still be accessible using the emulated environment used for the other WordStar 6 files that still exist in your Library or Archive. &#xD;&#xA;This leads us to the second reason why emulation may be a preferable option for your Library or Archive: it may be economically fairer. Emulation, unlike continued migration or normalisation, enables Libraries and Archives to pass the access/interaction costs on to the generation that is using the objects. Emulation is applied just in time rather than just  in case and so enables the cost to be born by the user (or the institution) at the time of use rather than by whoever is there whenever the files need to be migrated, or by the agency when the file is transferred and normalised. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a good point at which to address Normalisation. Functionally normalisation is the same as migration but conducted when the objects are first in the possession of the Library or Archive. Eventually all normalised files will also have to be migrated just as migrated files will eventually have to be re-migrated when the new files are no longer accessible. Any decent migration strategy should be migrating content to open formats and therefore should eventually get the same results as a (open standards based)  normalisation strategy would and therefore the two strategies can be equated and over the long term fall-prey to the same criticisms mentioned elsewhere in this answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So to readdress the questions Trevor asked:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**At what point, or under what conditions should a library or archive plan on emulation as a strategy for viewing and or making accessible particular kinds of content?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Library or Archive should decide on their strategy as earlier as possible to gain the most economic benefit as possible. They should choose emulation in most circumstances as it provides a better outcome, but most definitely when they have no other choice. They will not be able to choose emulation alone as a strategy for all content, e.g. content that has a physical component, however if they do choose emulation then it is likely that they will be economically better off and the costs of implementing their strategy will be more fairly distributed to the users that actually benefit from it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general though the most important things a Library or Archive can do right now to keep their options open in regards to access/interaction strategies are as follows:&#xD;&#xA;Document what you have. &#xD;&#xA;Fully understand the creating applications and intended rendering applications. &#xD;&#xA;Acquire software &amp; licenses for the software you may need to emulate&#xD;&#xA;Take snapshots of interaction environments (and potentially interesting desktops or servers). &#xD;&#xA;Have the creators tell you what the formats objects are structured using&#xD;&#xA;Have creators tell you which rendering environments should be used with their objects&#xD;&#xA;Have creators tell you what content should be preserved from digital files (including physical components and interactive components -e.g. is being able to turn on and off tracked changes important?) and which content can be removed during a preservation or access/interaction process. &#xD;&#xA;Thoroughly document the date the object was created - this can provide one of the best indicators for which tools might be needed for access/interaction. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emulation tools and services have the potential to provide an amazingly rich digital history experience. It is my hope that one day emulation will be the default and invisible option used for accessing older digital content.  Objects will automatically be opened in their intended rendering environment and users will be able to extract data and gain insight from the original content in the intended context. Hopefully my answer here helps convince others to get behind this vision also.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2011-05-19-remote-emulation&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33771879522/how-could-son-b-could-rely-on-the-emulation-solution&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/?comments=1&amp;post=21936534#comment-21936534&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.raspberrypi.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21565577-new-manufacturing-technique-could-help-poor-countries-well-rich-ones?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/athirdworlddimension&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.makerbot.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://archives.govt.nz/resources/information-management-research/rendering-matters-report-results-research-digital-object-r&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info/v1/migration-issues/wordstar-migration-to-ms-word/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.dshr.org/2007/04/format-obsolescence-scenarios.html&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authenticity_in_art&amp;oldid=516960597#Authenticity_of_performance&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33715122952/a-scenario-illustrating-the-importance-of-digital&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://dioscuri.sourceforge.net/" />

Standard rendering/interaction environments (e.g. “all of government desktops”) can be snapshotted and moved to emulated hardware for use in interaction/access the objects that are to be transferred.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these steps are much more difficult and costly, or impossible at a later date.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**How late can a Library or Archive leave deciding what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The  answer to this question will depend on what the impact will be of a Library or Archive leaving their decision until very late. &#xD;&#xA;What might the *negative* consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xD;&#xA;If they were to use emulation as their strategy at that point then:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. they might struggle to know which software to emulate to use for interacting with the objects (i.e. they may not be able to ascertain what the intended interaction environment should be). &#xD;&#xA; 2. There may be no emulator available for the particular environment they want to emulate and:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;     a) No documentation left to enable them to create a new emulator for that environment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;     b) A significant cost may need to be incurred to create a new emulator for that environment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;     c)No documentation left to enable use of emulated environment and effective interaction with the object by non-specialists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What might the *positive* consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Tools to identify original creation environment and associated default interaction environment may have been created and developed to a point of high functionality.&#xD;&#xA; 2. [Emulation services][1] may be available at a low cost that are simple to use and inexpensive (e.g. submit the object and it is remotely emulated and provided for interaction via a browser or local app).&#xD;&#xA; 3. End-user software documentation may be available and integrated with emulation tools and services as a “help-layer” enabling easy use of old software by users who have moved on to new interaction paradigms. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The consequences of leaving such a decision to such a late point when using other strategies will be different. When deciding which strategy your Library or Archive will use it will be worth considering the consequences of the decision with respect to all possible choices. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Under what conditions should a library or archive choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy rather than an alternative?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a number of ways to answer this question. Firstly, a Library or Archive should always choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy when there are no feasible alternatives. When might that be the case?&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**At what point does emulation become the only option as a digital preservation strategy?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is potential for an emulation solution to become the only option for a Library or Archive to use as their interaction/access strategy for their digital content. Such a situation might arise if the following conditions are met:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. necessary interaction software still exists&#xD;&#xA; 2. an emulator to run the software exists or can be constructed and tested using original compatibility tests (for more information on how to know when to trust an emulation solution see [here][2].) &#xD;&#xA; 3. using original hardware and software is not an option&#xD;&#xA; 4. no alternative interaction or viewing tools are available (such as migration/normalization tools). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many files have been created with structures that are not openly documented and for which the only tool available for interacting with or viewing the content captured in that structure is the original software.  In such cases, assuming the documentation outlining the way the software writes the files cannot be acquired, using the original hardware is not an option, and the original interaction software can be loaded into an emulated environment, then emulation will likely be the only option left  available. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It may be possible to use reprogrammable hardware such as a [Field Programmable Gate Array][3] to [create the original hardware in programmable hardware][4]. But for all intents and purposes this is effectively another (potentially faster) version of emulation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**When should a Library or Archive choose emulation as their interaction/access strategy only for particular kinds of content and another strategy for other kinds of content?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital object interaction/access strategies that rely solely on emulation will never be appropriate for interacting with or accessing object content that involves a hardware component. In such cases, for example when replicating the full experience of a video game as played on a particular console, emulation alone will not be enough for accessing/interacting with the content. Replica hardware, such as game controllers, may need to be produced in order to maintain the full content experience. The advent of inexpensive microcomputers such as the [raspberry pi][5] and [inexpensive 3D printers][6] such as the [MakerBot][7] may make this option much more viable and prevalent in the near future. &#xD;&#xA;A migration strategy that is able to be tested and confirmed for every object it is used to access may be more practical in some circumstances for use as a viewing/interaction strategy. For example if processing a lot of simple objects that have few components to them migration may be more economical. Unfortunately most migration tools and processes currently do not incorporate comprehensive testing procedures and [anecdotal][8] [evidence][9] suggests that migration processes can often destroy content. In such cases the processes are effectively failing at adequately enabling viewing or interaction with the object as the object no longer exists in the same form post migration. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most good migration candidates are simple objects that often can still be accessed by current software such as text-based formats and simple images. As they can often still be accessed by current software there is a [question to be asked][10] as to why the Library or Archive would bother migrating them at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Under what circumstances would emulation be a preferable option to the alternatives for accessing or interacting with content?.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In almost all cases employing an emulation strategy for interacting with or viewing old digital content will be preferable than any alternatives. Emulation gives a richer, more [authentic][11] experience that can often evoke more emotion and feeling in the viewer than just seeing some raw data would. When coupled with options to enable the user to print the emulated content they are viewing, to copy text &amp; images from the object into a modern environment, to print the content to a file, or to use the original rendering software to create a new file based on the old file but using a different save-as parameter (e.g. from a .doc file to a .rtf), the emulation experience is often a much fuller and more gratifying experience than alternatives. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When in a court of law in which digital evidence is being presented I would personally want to see the content that was presented using the original software, rather than seeing whatever content was left when the original file(s) was run through a migration process (i.e. see the actual content rather than manipulated/different content). I have blogged about this [here][12]. In fact this would be my preference in most if not all circumstances in which something important in my life hinged on some old digital content. Whether or not this is a widely held opinion still needs to be tested, however the Rules of the High Court of New Zealand were recently updated to include references to the need for preservation of “native electronic documents” when such objects are submitted as evidence. Native electronic documents or native file formats are defined as: “an electronic document stored in the original form in which it was created by a computer software program”. This may indicate a greater recognition of the need to enable access to/interaction with unaltered versions of digital objects. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Emulation may turn out to be cheaper and economically “fairer” than alternative options.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emulation may have two economic advantages over alternative methods:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once emulation services are in place the processes that Libraries or Archives need to implement if choosing an emulation strategy will likely be less onerous than alternatives. The essential steps for implementing an emulation strategy in such an organisation are to know what environments they need for interacting with all their digital objects and to make sure a service exists that provides that environment. The organisations can then choose which business model to operate under to enable access to/interaction with the objects. They might, for example, have a few workstations in their buildings for users to use at no cost for interacting with the objects. And/or they may have a limited set of remote-access licenses. In such cases the end-users would have an option for no-cost access to the objects but if they want to they could also pay for a remote service themselves. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to these optional business models and the low initial cost for Libraries and Archives, emulation tools services are likely to cost less to maintain over time. A single emulator can be used to maintain thousands of emulation environments (or more). The long term maintenance costs will relate to migrating the emulator to new host environments over time. To reduce this cost, initiatives such as [Dioscuri][13]  the modular emulator offer mechanisms for lowering this cost by removing the need to migrate much of the code base. Most importantly though, the cost of migrating the one emulator to enable the continued emulation of thousands of environments, which in turn enables continued access to millions/billions of digital objects, is likely to be much less than the cost to continually migrate each individual digital file over time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore with emulation you are always able to open objects structured with a particular format. With migration/normalisation you may have to decide how long you want to maintain a migration path for. So, for example, if in 100 years time someone comes to you with a WordStar 6 file that they found on a server of legacy objects, there may no longer be a migration path available for it. On the other hand, if emulation had been the chosen strategy for those files then they will still be accessible using the emulated environment used for the other WordStar 6 files that still exist in your Library or Archive. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This leads us to the second reason why emulation may be a preferable option for your Library or Archive: it may be economically fairer. Emulation, unlike continued migration or normalisation, enables Libraries and Archives to pass the access/interaction costs on to the generation that is using the objects. Emulation is applied just in time rather than just  in case and so enables the cost to be born by the user (or the institution) at the time of use rather than by whoever is there whenever the files need to be migrated, or by the agency when the file is transferred and normalised. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a good point at which to address Normalisation. Functionally normalisation is the same as migration but conducted when the objects are first in the possession of the Library or Archive. Eventually all normalised files will also have to be migrated just as migrated files will eventually have to be re-migrated when the new files are no longer accessible. Any decent migration strategy should be migrating content to open formats and therefore should eventually get the same results as a (open standards based)  normalisation strategy would and therefore the two strategies can be equated and over the long term fall-prey to the same criticisms mentioned elsewhere in this answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So to readdress the questions Trevor asked:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**At what point, or under what conditions should a library or archive plan on emulation as a strategy for viewing and or making accessible particular kinds of content?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Library or Archive should decide on their strategy as early as possible to gain the most economic benefit as possible. They should choose emulation in most circumstances as it provides a better outcome, but most definitely when they have no other choice. They will not be able to choose emulation alone as a strategy for all content, e.g. content that has a physical component, however if they do choose emulation then it is likely that they will be economically better off and the costs of implementing their strategy will be more fairly distributed to the users that actually benefit from it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general though the most important things a Library or Archive can do right now to keep their options open in regards to access/interaction strategies are as follows:&#xD;&#xA;Document what you have. &#xD;&#xA;Fully understand the creating applications and intended rendering applications. &#xD;&#xA;Acquire software &amp; licenses for the software you may need to emulate&#xD;&#xA;Take snapshots of interaction environments (and potentially interesting desktops or servers). &#xD;&#xA;Have the creators tell you what the formats objects are structured using&#xD;&#xA;Have creators tell you which rendering environments should be used with their objects&#xD;&#xA;Have creators tell you what content should be preserved from digital files (including physical components and interactive components -e.g. is being able to turn on and off tracked changes important?) and which content can be removed during a preservation or access/interaction process. &#xD;&#xA;Thoroughly document the date the object was created - this can provide one of the best indicators for which tools might be needed for access/interaction. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emulation tools and services have the potential to provide an amazingly rich digital history experience. It is my hope that one day emulation will be the default and invisible option used for accessing older digital content.  Objects will automatically be opened in their intended rendering environment and users will be able to extract data and gain insight from the original content in the intended context. Hopefully my answer here helps convince others to get behind this vision also.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2011-05-19-remote-emulation&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33771879522/how-could-son-b-could-rely-on-the-emulation-solution&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/?comments=1&amp;post=21936534#comment-21936534&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.raspberrypi.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21565577-new-manufacturing-technique-could-help-poor-countries-well-rich-ones?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/athirdworlddimension&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.makerbot.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://archives.govt.nz/resources/information-management-research/rendering-matters-report-results-research-digital-object-r&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info/v1/migration-issues/wordstar-migration-to-ms-word/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.dshr.org/2007/04/format-obsolescence-scenarios.html&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authenticity_in_art&amp;oldid=516960597#Authenticity_of_performance&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33715122952/a-scenario-illustrating-the-importance-of-digital&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://dioscuri.sourceforge.net/" />

Knowing their strategy at such a point would enable them to provide guidance to creators that would:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Enable the creators to create without unnecessary limitations&#xD;&#xA; 2. Enable efficient and effective continued long term access to the objects&#xD;&#xA; 3. Not be cost-prohibitive over the projected life of the objects to either the creator or future steward of the digital objects&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In reality both Libraries and Archives rarely have a sufficient degree of influence over the creation of the content that they end up handling to be able to enforce the application of any guidance they might want to give. As a result it is worthwhile to consider other points at which Libraries and Archives might benefit most from deciding upon their interaction/access strategy for their digital objects.&#xD;&#xA;If emulation were to be enacted as a long term access/interaction (I’ve substituted interaction for viewing here as I suspect that is what Trevor is more interested in) strategy then the next best time for the Library or Archive to decide to do this is likely to be before they accept items for transfer to the Library or Archive. Making the decision at that point enables a number of key steps to be included in the transfer process that will make enacting the emulation strategy much easier:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Intended rendering applications/environments can be identified via the transferring agency or donor.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Software licenses and binaries can be transferred to the Library or Archive.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Standard rendering/interaction environments (e.g. “all of government desktops”) can be snapshotted and moved to emulated hardware for use in interaction/access the objects that are to be transferred.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these steps are much more difficult and costly, or impossible at a later date.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**How late can a Library or Archive leave deciding what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The  answer to this question will depend on what the impact will be of a Library or Archive leaving their decision until very late. &#xD;&#xA;What might the *negative* consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xD;&#xA;If they were to use emulation as their strategy at that point then:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. they might struggle to know which software to emulate to use for interacting with the objects (i.e. they may not be able to ascertain what the intended interaction environment should be). &#xD;&#xA; 2.

  <row Id="3236" PostHistoryTypeId="5" PostId="1259" RevisionGUID="8f419544-4086-48a1-b4c4-832e8d4734ad" CreationDate="2012-11-05T01:20:45.067" UserId="766" Comment="added 84 characters in body" Text="Trevor, I’m not sure if it was intended but your question could be interpreted in many ways.&#xD;&#xA;I’ll attempt below to answer most of the interpretations I’ve identified.&#xD;&#xA;The question was:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**At what point, or under what conditions should a library or archive plan on emulation as a strategy for viewing and or making accessible particular kinds of content?**&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;At what point should a Library or Archive decide what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be?&#xD;&#xA;Ideally Libraries and Archives should know what their interaction or access strategy will be before the objects that they will be handling are created. Knowing their strategy at such a point would enable them to provide guidance to creators that would:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Enable the creators to create without unnecessary limitations on which software or formats they should use (formats can restrict functionality)&#xD;&#xA; 2. Enable efficient and effective continued long term access to the objects&#xD;&#xA; 3. Not be cost-prohibitive over the projected life of the objects to either the creator or future steward of the digital objects&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In reality both Libraries and Archives rarely have a sufficient degree of influence over the creation of the content that they end up handling to be able to enforce the application of any guidance they might want to give. As a result it is worthwhile to consider other points at which Libraries and Archives might benefit most from deciding upon their interaction/access strategy for their digital objects.&#xD;&#xA;If emulation were to be enacted as a long term access/interaction (I’ve substituted interaction for viewing here as I suspect that is what Trevor is more interested in) strategy then the next best time for the Library or Archive to decide to do this is likely to be before they accept items for transfer to the Library or Archive. Making the decision at that point enables a number of key steps to be included in the transfer process that will make enacting the emulation strategy much easier:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Intended rendering applications/environments can be identified via the transferring agency or donor.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Software licenses and binaries can be transferred to the Library or Archive.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Standard rendering/interaction environments (e.g. “all of government desktops”) can be snapshotted and moved to emulated hardware for use in interaction/access the objects that are to be transferred.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these steps are much more difficult and costly, or impossible at a later date.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**How late can a Library or Archive leave deciding what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The  answer to this question will depend on what the impact will be of a Library or Archive leaving their decision until very late. &#xD;&#xA;What might the *negative* consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xD;&#xA;If they were to use emulation as their strategy at that point then:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. they might struggle to know which software to emulate to use for interacting with the objects (i.e. they may not be able to ascertain what the intended interaction environment should be). &#xD;&#xA; 2. There may be no emulator available for the particular environment they want to emulate and:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;     a) No documentation left to enable them to create a new emulator for that environment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;     b) A significant cost may need to be incurred to create a new emulator for that environment&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;     c)No documentation left to enable use of emulated environment and effective interaction with the object by non-specialists.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What might the *positive* consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Tools to identify original creation environment and associated default interaction environment may have been created and developed to a point of high functionality.&#xD;&#xA; 2. [Emulation services][1] may be available at a low cost that are simple to use and inexpensive (e.g. submit the object and it is remotely emulated and provided for interaction via a browser or local app).&#xD;&#xA; 3. End-user software documentation may be available and integrated with emulation tools and services as a “help-layer” enabling easy use of old software by users who have moved on to new interaction paradigms. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The consequences of leaving such a decision to such a late point when using other strategies will be different. When deciding which strategy your Library or Archive will use it will be worth considering the consequences of the decision with respect to all possible choices. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Under what conditions should a library or archive choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy rather than an alternative?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a number of ways to answer this question. Firstly, a Library or Archive should always choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy when there are no feasible alternatives. When might that be the case?&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;**At what point does emulation become the only option as a digital preservation strategy?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is potential for an emulation solution to become the only option for a Library or Archive to use as their interaction/access strategy for their digital content. Such a situation might arise if the following conditions are met:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. necessary interaction software still exists&#xD;&#xA; 2. an emulator to run the software exists or can be constructed and tested using original compatibility tests (for more information on how to know when to trust an emulation solution see [here][2].) &#xD;&#xA; 3. using original hardware and software is not an option&#xD;&#xA; 4. no alternative interaction or viewing tools are available (such as migration/normalization tools). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many files have been created with structures that are not openly documented and for which the only tool available for interacting with or viewing the content captured in that structure is the original software.  In such cases, assuming the documentation outlining the way the software writes the files cannot be acquired, using the original hardware is not an option, and the original interaction software can be loaded into an emulated environment, then emulation will likely be the only option left  available. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It may be possible to use reprogrammable hardware such as a [Field Programmable Gate Array][3] to [create the original hardware in programmable hardware][4]. But for all intents and purposes this is effectively another (potentially faster) version of emulation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**When should a Library or Archive choose emulation as their interaction/access strategy only for particular kinds of content and another strategy for other kinds of content?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Digital object interaction/access strategies that rely solely on emulation will never be appropriate for interacting with or accessing object content that involves a hardware component. In such cases, for example when replicating the full experience of a video game as played on a particular console, emulation alone will not be enough for accessing/interacting with the content. Replica hardware, such as game controllers, may need to be produced in order to maintain the full content experience. The advent of inexpensive microcomputers such as the [raspberry pi][5] and [inexpensive 3D printers][6] such as the [MakerBot][7] may make this option much more viable and prevalent in the near future. &#xD;&#xA;A migration strategy that is able to be tested and confirmed for every object it is used to access may be more practical in some circumstances for use as a viewing/interaction strategy. For example if processing a lot of simple objects that have few components to them migration may be more economical. Unfortunately most migration tools and processes currently do not incorporate comprehensive testing procedures and [anecdotal][8] [evidence][9] suggests that migration processes can often destroy content. In such cases the processes are effectively failing at adequately enabling viewing or interaction with the object as the object no longer exists in the same form post migration. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most good migration candidates are simple objects that often can still be accessed by current software such as text-based formats and simple images. As they can often still be accessed by current software there is a [question to be asked][10] as to why the Library or Archive would bother migrating them at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Under what circumstances would emulation be a preferable option to the alternatives for accessing or interacting with content?.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In almost all cases employing an emulation strategy for interacting with or viewing old digital content will be preferable than any alternatives. Emulation gives a richer, more [authentic][11] experience that can often evoke more emotion and feeling in the viewer than just seeing some raw data would. When coupled with options to enable the user to print the emulated content they are viewing, to copy text &amp; images from the object into a modern environment, to print the content to a file, or to use the original rendering software to create a new file based on the old file but using a different save-as parameter (e.g. from a .doc file to a .rtf), the emulation experience is often a much fuller and more gratifying experience than alternatives. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When in a court of law in which digital evidence is being presented I would personally want to see the content that was presented using the original software, rather than seeing whatever content was left when the original file(s) was run through a migration process (i.e. see the actual content rather than manipulated/different content). I have blogged about this [here][12]. In fact this would be my preference in most if not all circumstances in which something important in my life hinged on some old digital content. Whether or not this is a widely held opinion still needs to be tested, however the Rules of the High Court of New Zealand were recently updated to include references to the need for preservation of “native electronic documents” when such objects are submitted as evidence. Native electronic documents or native file formats are defined as: “an electronic document stored in the original form in which it was created by a computer software program”. This may indicate a greater recognition of the need to enable access to/interaction with unaltered versions of digital objects. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Emulation may turn out to be cheaper and economically “fairer” than alternative options.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emulation may have two economic advantages over alternative methods:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once emulation services are in place the processes that Libraries or Archives need to implement if choosing an emulation strategy will likely be less onerous than alternatives. The essential steps for implementing an emulation strategy in such an organisation are to know what environments they need for interacting with all their digital objects and to make sure a service exists that provides that environment. The organisations can then choose which business model to operate under to enable access to/interaction with the objects. They might, for example, have a few workstations in their buildings for users to use at no cost for interacting with the objects. And/or they may have a limited set of remote-access licenses. In such cases the end-users would have an option for no-cost access to the objects but if they want to they could also pay for a remote service themselves. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition to these optional business models and the low initial cost for Libraries and Archives, emulation tools services are likely to cost less to maintain over time. A single emulator can be used to maintain thousands of emulation environments (or more). The long term maintenance costs will relate to migrating the emulator to new host environments over time. To reduce this cost, initiatives such as [Dioscuri][13]  the modular emulator offer mechanisms for lowering this cost by removing the need to migrate much of the code base. Most importantly though, the cost of migrating the one emulator to enable the continued emulation of thousands of environments, which in turn enables continued access to millions/billions of digital objects, is likely to be much less than the cost to continually migrate each individual digital file over time. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore with emulation you are always able to open objects structured with a particular format. With migration/normalisation you may have to decide how long you want to maintain a migration path for. So, for example, if in 100 years time someone comes to you with a WordStar 6 file that they found on a server of legacy objects, there may no longer be a migration path available for it. On the other hand, if emulation had been the chosen strategy for those files then they will still be accessible using the emulated environment used for the other WordStar 6 files that still exist in your Library or Archive. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This leads us to the second reason why emulation may be a preferable option for your Library or Archive: it may be economically fairer. Emulation, unlike continued migration or normalisation, enables Libraries and Archives to pass the access/interaction costs on to the generation that is using the objects. Emulation is applied just in time rather than just  in case and so enables the cost to be born by the user (or the institution) at the time of use rather than by whoever is there whenever the files need to be migrated, or by the agency when the file is transferred and normalised. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a good point at which to address Normalisation. Functionally normalisation is the same as migration but conducted when the objects are first in the possession of the Library or Archive. Eventually all normalised files will also have to be migrated just as migrated files will eventually have to be re-migrated when the new files are no longer accessible. Any decent migration strategy should be migrating content to open formats and therefore should eventually get the same results as a (open standards based)  normalisation strategy would and therefore the two strategies can be equated and over the long term fall-prey to the same criticisms mentioned elsewhere in this answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So to readdress the questions Trevor asked:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**At what point, or under what conditions should a library or archive plan on emulation as a strategy for viewing and or making accessible particular kinds of content?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Library or Archive should decide on their strategy as early as possible to gain the most economic benefit as possible. They should choose emulation in most circumstances as it provides a better outcome, but most definitely when they have no other choice. They will not be able to choose emulation alone as a strategy for all content, e.g. content that has a physical component, however if they do choose emulation then it is likely that they will be economically better off and the costs of implementing their strategy will be more fairly distributed to the users that actually benefit from it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general though the most important things a Library or Archive can do right now to keep their options open in regards to access/interaction strategies are as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Document what you have. &#xD;&#xA; - Fully understand the creating applications and intended interaction applications. &#xD;&#xA; - Acquire software &amp; licenses for the software you may need to emulate&#xD;&#xA; - Take snapshots of interaction environments (and potentially interesting desktops or servers). &#xD;&#xA; - Have the creators tell you what the formats objects are structured using&#xD;&#xA; - Have creators tell you which environments should be used with their objects&#xD;&#xA; - Have creators tell you what content should be preserved from digital files (including physical components and interactive components -e.g. is being able to turn on and off tracked changes important?) and which content can be removed during a preservation or access/interaction process.&#xD;&#xA; - Thoroughly document the date the object was created - this can provide one of the best indicators for which tools might be needed for access/interaction. &#xD;&#xA; - Provide support for the development of tools and services&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Emulation tools and services have the potential to provide an amazingly rich digital history experience. It is my hope that one day emulation will be the default and invisible option used for accessing older digital content.  Objects will automatically be opened in their intended interaction environment and users will be able to extract data and gain insight from the original content in the intended context. Hopefully my answer here helps convince others to get behind this vision also.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2011-05-19-remote-emulation&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33771879522/how-could-son-b-could-rely-on-the-emulation-solution&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/?comments=1&amp;post=21936534#comment-21936534&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.raspberrypi.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21565577-new-manufacturing-technique-could-help-poor-countries-well-rich-ones?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/athirdworlddimension&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.makerbot.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://archives.govt.nz/resources/information-management-research/rendering-matters-report-results-research-digital-object-r&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info/v1/migration-issues/wordstar-migration-to-ms-word/&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://blog.dshr.org/2007/04/format-obsolescence-scenarios.html&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authenticity_in_art&amp;oldid=516960597#Authenticity_of_performance&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33715122952/a-scenario-illustrating-the-importance-of-digital&#xD;&#xA;  [13]: http://dioscuri.sourceforge.net/" />

Someone donating on our website may be confused as to whom they are donating; they might also think that paying membership dues makes them a member of the library. I know from an accounting audit standpoint, all funds must be kept separate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many libraries require their Friends group to maintain their own website (which can be linked to from the library's site). This seems the simplest way to keep a separation between the groups. Our Friends group does not have the technical resources to do this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So finally, my question:&#xD;&#xA;Is it essential to keep websites and donation buttons separate for the library and the Friends group, and why?&#xD;&#xA;" />

Once the text line images are available, the HTR models can be fully automatically obtained using powerful, well known training techniques, which only require the (whole) transcripts of a reasonably small number of these (unsegmented) line images.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Despite recent significant improvements, currently available HTR technologies are still far from offering fully automated solutions for transcription.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you interested in knowing more about HTR for transcription of historical documents you can visit the [transcriptorium][1] project web page, and the [HTR][2] web page of the PRHLT research group&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.transcriptorium.eu&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://prhlt.iti.upv.es/showcase/htr/" />

The problem I have run into with it is that you end up teaching to the slowest student, and your quicker students jump ahead and then miss instruction because they were in the wrong place. My suggestion (based on years of teaching in a variety of situations):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Start with a presentation that previews what they will do, complete with handouts they will use at the computer. It may include a demonstration rather than slides.&#xD;&#xA; 2. Next, send them to the computers with a list of applicable tasks and have them work in pairs. People are amazing at helping each other - one of them will have heard one step and another a different step, and between them they will figure it out. The instructor moves from station to station to help when pairs are stuck or to answer questions that grow from the exercises.&#xD;&#xA; 3. Finally, let people explore on their own, using the software for their own purpose. The instructor can move student to student, but as students work on their own, if you are busy they will tend to ask others around them since they have practice in this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have used this successfully with 6-year-olds learning to program with Logo all the way up to architects learning to use CAD software. It does make for a long teaching session. If you are teaching something simple or small in scope, you may be able to skip the second or third step, but I would avoid trying to orchestrate having everyone do the same thing at the same time.

I know that this sounds like self-marketing but even the biggest companies haven't implemented what is possible with JPEG2000 and I talked to many of them. Kakadu is by far the best API, especially performance-wise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Noboy will ever implement JPEG2000 with a single line of code like we were used to and that is the only reason why the adoption rate is low.&#xD;&#xA;What is worse, we all got used to simply copying images.

However, even in this case, migration to WARC is awkward and error prone, because to rebuild the http playback you need to accurately mock up the server headers. Little things, like getting the MIME type right for formats that are hard to identify automatically like CSS and JavaScript, cause us a lot of headaches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, the idea of taking files that were never on the web and mocking up the entire think make me very nervous! I would not be comfortable discarding the BagIt SIP because you are taking files out and discarding and filesystem metadata and the original inventory etc. and your QA procedure will need to be very tight, up to and including verifying playback via Wayback. I'm pretty sure that, by default, Wayback won't support arbitrary URNs, and therefore you'll have a lot of setup to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What's wrong with just keeping the bag anyway?

The Makerspace is an extension of this as well as the fairly traditional role of the library as a community space. In a Makerspace, knowledge and skills are shared democratically across age groups. The library serves as physical resource, materials resource, as moderator, and perhaps also as teacher. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, it is not a match for every library's mission, and it also dilutes a library's focus. We do so much already, and to keep adding things on our plates means we probably do all things less well. For some libraries, it may be an attempt to be more relevant to an otherwise disinterested community - like gaming, which was about getting kids into the library where they might discover the other cool things we do, and making the library a place were kids feel comfortable coming so that they might come back for other reasons in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I personally think it's a trend, and like gaming, it will be attempted and then replaced in many libraries, surviving in the few where the community really takes an interest. I think in the library world, we have a tendency to jump on to new ideas because other libraries are doing them instead of really looking at what our community is asking for. I don't think it is a match for my community any more than gaming was.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do see a need in my community for community engagement, however. People come into the library to connect with other people - the staff, the volunteers, the other people in our various programs.

If the images represent a more-or-less casual record, then the JPEGs may be sufficient (they contain sufficient information for most display and printing purposes). But the NEFF files will definitely contain the most information; they will allow more flexible further post-processing (for example, images may be 12 or 14 bits per channel rather than 8 bits for JPEG; there will be information on white balance settings etc, that can be adjusted). If you want to ensure you retain that information for future use, retain the NEFF files. Converting to TIFF will lose (camera-oriented) information; converting to DNG can retain all information provided you embed the original raw, ie the DNG is then bigger (although it _may_ be more future proof). Not certain how good Nikon and others have been in keeping backwards compatibility with earlier versions of NEFF." />

As the new [Lytro camera shows][1] (though that is a special case),  there is often a lot of value that can be gained from the data embedded in image files. &#xD;&#xA;Having said that, if you select an appropriate format you may see great space gains with very little information lost if you move to, e.g. JPEG-2000. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as content-based weeding goes, you may want to try something like [this][2], however automated content based indexing tools are still fairly inaccurate so any weeding based on content will mostly have to be done manually. One option might be to put up the jpegs online and have the public, (or some students) tag all the images to aid in automated assessment of which you want to keep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might also be able to script/automate reverse image searches via [google reverse image search][3] or [tineye][4], and add metadata that way to help aid in automated weeding/disposal. For example if you got any hits for an image of a person, that might help you to identify the person from the metadata associated with the related images, and then you may be in a better position to decide if you want to keep that image or not. It also looks like google's reverse image search can also [do some object identification][5] now, though I am not sure how accurate it is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as working with 15TB goes, its mostly a matter of scaling up all processes you have used in the past or developing more efficient processes if you cant afford to scale those ones. You also often come across I/O bottlenecks when moving/copying large volumes of data that you will have to account for in any projections around time-scales etc. Having processes that do not completely fail if one file processed fails can also help as when e.g. running overnight batch ingest processes, you can lose a lot of time from a single file which can be costly when you are dealing with such volume. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/10/lytro-reveals-its-software-side-at-ces-video/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://grimesinf1240.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/awesome-new-visualcontent-analysis.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/images/searchbyimage.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.tineye.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://your-digital-life.com/sharing/identify-objects-in-photos-with-google-image-search/" />

So here's my take on the questions asked:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do we want the NEF files?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm going to look at a bit differently than most -- what you have are two different Works -- effectively, there's the taking of the picture, but there's also the correction of the picture by the photographer, which is *not* in the NEF files.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're trying to archive the artist's finished work, then the NEF files are useless.  If you're trying to show his creative process, then they might have value.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The discussions of bits per channel is misleading -- if we were to talk about books, think of the NEF file as a high resolution scan of an early draft of a written work, and the JPEG has a lower resolution scan of the published work.  Yes, one's of higher resolution, but does it actually capture something that's worth keeping?  (and it might, it's going to vary for each collection ingested)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What would be the potential loss to the archives and to the historical&#xD;&#xA;&gt; record if we only preserved the JPGs?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You're losing provenance information.  If *might* be possible to reconstruct a higher-fidelity facsimile of the images represented in the JPEGs, but that would require some significant reconstructive efforts that would likely not be appropriate for most archives to do except for very special cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; If we take the NEF files, do we convert them immediately to DNG, TIFF or another format?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've done a little bit of reading up on NEF, and as it's based on TIFF/EP, I'd suggest reading the [Library of Congress's notes on TIFF/EP for preservation](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000073.shtml), and specifically the link to [What's in a Raw File?](http://www.barrypearson.co.uk/articles/dng/raw.htm) which talks about NEF to DNG conversion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not an expert on any of these file formats, but I'd recommend when possible, selecting an open format that's in wide use right now for the best chance of being likely to read it again in the future.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What about some kind of heuristically-guided, content-based weeding? In other words, we keep both versions of every image we're keeping, but we are selective about which images we keep.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are there corresponding DNG files for every JPEG?  If so, that might be something to eliminate.  (eg, the equivalent of a photographer not making prints from every negative).  And as you mention, similarity to other photos may be the reason, if the photographer selected what they considered 'best' ... but depending on the purpose of the archive, someone doing future research may be interested in what the photographer considered to be sub-par.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(depending on the type of work they did, it's possible that they weren't making the selections, eg, if it were wedding photos or something else where a client might decide which ones they wanted, and then the additional processing was done)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And remember, you have options besides not accepting the image -- it may be that you reduce the individual files -- either lossy compression or rescaling so that you preserve every image, but possibly not at the full fidelity that you received them.  You may want to identify how much storage you can devote to this, and then come up with various scenarios:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* keep 50% of the images at original size, discard the rest&#xD;&#xA;* keep 40% of the images at original size, the rest reduced to 1/6 their size&#xD;&#xA;* keep 30% of the images at original size, the rest reduced to ~1/4 their size&#xD;&#xA;* keep 40% of the images in the main repository, the rest on a lower class of storage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, this could get really complex ... the first analysis pass may not identify enough candidates for weeding, and so you may have to expend more resources for additional analysis, making it cheaper to adjust the strategy or allocate more storage..&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For those of you who work in this scale routinely, what computational or other challenges will this volume pose that we probably haven't encountered before?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have to reprocess the data, there might be some computational issues, but it might be possible to use cloud computing for this.  The main issue that I run into is access -- we don't want to serve the full resolution file if there is some smaller variant that will suffice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Eg, if you have 20 megapixel images, most people won't need that resolution if they're just browsing through the images.  You might be able to serve images at 1/2 or 1/4 scale (1/4 or 1/16 the pixel count) for most people.  Those that want to zoom in to see detail could then request the higher fidelity image if the browse image won't suffice for their needs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ideally, you could use something like JPEG2000 and a JPIP server so that you don't have to maintain multiple processed forms of the images, but support isn't currently baked into most web browsers, so you have to have some sort of intermediary service do the conversion between JPEG2000 and JPEG.  I don't know what the current status is for this sort of thing in conventional archives, as we have some abnormal use cases and interface with a bunch of ad-hoc services.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I guess the only real consideration that I can think of is how you're going to be getting the files.  Depending on the schedule that you'll be ingesting, over the network may not be efficient.  For large, bulk transfers (eg, the 15TB initial load), we physically transport the disks.  (USB or firewire drives + FedEx or UPS if it's long distance)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I find that 15TB isn't really the important number, the important issues are the maximum image size (can we open them to look at them, or are they too large for most of our current desktops?) and the number of discrete files (it takes just as long to catalog a 50kB image as a 50MB one, once you get past the process of opening the file)&#xD;&#xA;" />

The Jpeg compression works by 'throwing away' higher frequency information. What does the jpeg compression thats been applied do to the resulting image? a good implementation of a jpeg compressor, set to a light compression ratio can be visually imperceptible in an image.

What access do you have to storage? is your solution going to gracefully scale to fulfill this requirement? Whats the slightly longer term perspective (being cognisant of Moore's and Kryder's Laws...). Are these files being kept somewhere safe while you explore/research and decision make? What risks are associated with their current storage carrier? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From an access angle... who is going to be the primary user of this collection. Will they be happy being offered large NEF files that they need to interpret somehow to see the images? Will you / do you currently offer access copies - could these be the JPGs and save you a processing step elsewhere in your lifecycle?   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moving on. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;If we take the NEF files, do we convert them immediately to DNG, TIFF or another format?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For me, I would be exploring this very quickly, probably 2nd priority. What version of NEF are they? what tools currently exist to interact with them. Is there a current viable format I could move them too? or am I just kicking the can a little way down the road... &#xD;&#xA;TIFF does not offer the same capability as the NEF file, so I would argue its not a lossless transformation, and thus it doesn't really belong in this discussion, its a 'middle' format between NEF and jpg. Higher visual fidelity is achievable, but not all the features of the NEF can be captured. Repeat the tests between the JPG and NEF to get a feel for any informational loss. (if a lossy compression is used).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ask yourself, is DNG stable enough? supported enough with render tools and other methods of interacting with DNG file types?

A nice way to consider the position is to flip this straight to an analogue paradigm. Its not identical, but it works close enough. Assuming there is a 1:1 relationship between the NEF and JPG files, the NEF are the print negatives and the JPG are the print positive. &#xD;&#xA;Now how does that fit with your existing collection strategy? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;it looks safe to estimate that the NEF files make up about 2/3 of the storage space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Find out. This is one of your most urgent tasks - to know what to do, you must first understand what you have. Find out the relationship between NEF:TIF instances of the same intellectual object. Find out the number of each. Find out the average sizes of each type (plus standard deviation so you can see how close the set is to the average) - use a file listing application for this. Find out the resolutions for the two sets - (NEF should be relatively easy - close cohesion to the average file size? very likely all the same resolution, jpg? use exiftool and pull out just the h x w resolution, h/w resolution dpi, and possibly bit depth from the exif - throw that into a db  / spread sheet, and look through the range of sizes you. You might be able to throw away Lo Res jpgs from the off).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt;What would be the potential loss to the archives and to the historical record if we only preserved the JPGs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A very broad question, with lots of missing parts of the story for us to judge on. Assuming the JPGs are all acceptably high quality versions of the NEF files, arguably not a great deal.... unless you are interested in documenting the photographic process - example - what is the relationship between the NEF &amp; JPEG? cropping? tonal shifts? touch up? de-skew/rotation? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a technical angle, the NEF will offer significantly higher informational density for the image, but you should consider what that informational density represents. The Jpeg compression works by 'throwing away' higher frequency information. What does the jpeg compression thats been applied do to the resulting image? a good implementation of a jpeg compressor, set to a light compression ratio can be visually imperceptible in an image. A poor one is very noticeable. &#xD;&#xA;At this point, its a trade off. If you wanted, you could profile the difference between the two &quot;identical&quot; images in a couple of ways - computationally you can find the RMSe noise ratio between two images, do some experiments so you understand what the RMSe value is telling you, or your could open them both, and 'subtract' one from the other, looking at the 'difference' channel. This will show you where there is a difference between the tow images. Do this a few times, and start to understand the representational difference between the two types.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a storage angle... What access do you have to storage? is your solution going to gracefully scale to fulfill this requirement?

It could actually bear an impact on answers here if you could provide that information. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of this, I would advocate a solution where you DO migrate but maintain the originals. One way is to keep two digital objects. This has its own technical implications beyond the scope of this answer. Another mechanism which a colleague of mine adopted for digital objects was to maintain a binary diff of the old and new objects using bsdiff. Adopting this approach one could apply bspatch to the new file to re-create the old one bit for bit without having to keep the original around - thus saving on storage. Again this approach has its own technical implications and you should study the output to understand the size of bspatch files created from bsdiff. This will also be more beneficial for files where binary changes are small and files that you are unlikely to migrate again for a while.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further you need to think about controlling your migration and what output format you are selecting. For example, why have you elected PDF/A over a like for like migration, say PDF 1.7 (broken) -&gt; PDF 1.7 (fixed)? You can study the bitstreams in both cases to understand what changes have been made during the migration. I would hypothesize the changes would be more conservative in the latter and maybe more in-keeping with the original and therefore more suitable for your needs. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More information on bsdiff/bspatch: http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/" />

Hope that helps!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fV9iNRkEgoGC3zX19jz7bzBM4CJn6l_E7D4Fw32kAzM/edit" />

Many of the other answers address the technical characterization. I'm more interested in the content characterization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1) In addition to the various utilities to extract technical characteristics, visualization tools are invaluable assistant in appraising ingests of large digital collections. General tools like disk space analyzers [WinDirStat](http://windirstat.info/) and [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/) offer a great foothold into exploring and appraising large, unknown collections by creating a visual comparison of the size of folders. Both of the tools I mentioned are stand-alone, portable and very easy to use. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Technical metadata tools can help explore the contents of a collection textually. &lt;a href=&quot;http://library.duke.edu/uarchives/about/tools/data-accessioner.html&quot;&gt;Duke Data Accessioner&lt;/a&gt; comes with plug-ins for JHOVE and DROID. It's not as comprehensive as FITS, but it has a GUI and is more user friendly. Ben Goldman from the American Heritage Center has built a workflow using DDA and explains some of his justification here. http://e-records.chrisprom.com/guest-post-ben-goldman/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DDA transfers information off of storage media to a workspace and generates a METS file with the identified file formats and folder structure. When I was testing it, it was much easier to read the METS in an XML editor like Oxygen (costs ~$500) so that I could zoom into and out of the folders as was necessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) On the horizon are tools that take extracted technical metadata and turn it into human-readable information. [C3PO](http://ifs.tuwien.ac.at/imp/c3po) is a project out of Tuwein that visualizes FITS output. Look at the [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KibTpdxQBs) starting at 3:20 for the results. These are the kind of tools that will be essential to appraising large collections like [the digital photography collection discussed on this site](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/1371/digital-preservation-questions-of-format-and-volume-for-a-digital-photography-c). Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to experiment with C3PO myself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit 25-01-2013: Rearranged to incorporate more information about visualization tools." />

For example, see [this poster presented at IDCC2013][1]. In my opinion, this migration activity is unnecessary and possibly damaging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The JHOVE tools assess a particular file's adherence to its respective format specification. They do not specifically report on long term preservation risks that the PDF might contain. The two might overlap, but in many cases they are different, so further (and considered) interpretation of what these tools report is essential. The answers to [this stack question][2] should be useful in making this interpretation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So what defines a file format? In theory the file format specification and perhaps also (as Andy mentions) a [reference implementation][3] (eg. JasPer for JPEG2000 or Acrobat for PDF). However, particular files themselves are defined by one thing, and one thing only: the creating application. How closely the creating application adheres to a file format specification varies from application to application. Many don't adhere particularly closely and as a result, rendering applications tend to be very tolerant of common breaches of the relevant specifications (whether these breaches are due to poor implementation of the creating application, or alternative interpretations of ambiguous format specifications). And of course file format specifications and reference implementations don't always match up. In summary, a file format is to an extent a fuzzy concept, rather than the precise description implied by a &quot;file format specification&quot; document.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So given this somewhat confusing picture, what do we need to worry about when we acquire a PDF that we want to preserve for the long term?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There appears to be a growing consensus in the community (I only have anecdotal evidence for this) that if a file is judged invalid in relation to it's file format specification, but renders completely without problem in most common renderers, then there is no significant long term risk. This is of course arguable. The counter argument would suggest that rebuilding a renderer from the specification at a future time when the format had become obsolete would not lead ultimately to successful rendering of the invalid file. In my opinion, this scenario seems rather unlikely when we have open source code (eg. xpdf) that does tolerate invalid files, and should provide some insurance against &quot;catastrophic obsolescence&quot; scenarios.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If action *were* to be taken in migrating an invalid PDF to a valid PDF, there are some key issues to think about. Any format migration is potentially very dangerous and could result in damage to the content. It's therefore important to keep the original, or consider keeping a diff of the transform (as Ross suggested), and perform some kind of quality check on the new file. Given the difficulty in performing this check in an automated manner, the case for *not* migrating to address invalid-ness becomes stronger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/idcc13posters/Poster213.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/964/what-preservation-risks-are-associated-with-the-pdf-file-format&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation" />

Anything of the &quot;warning&quot; type is likely to be largely inconsequential (N.B. - **likely**). E.g. the DateTime field is not completed using the expected separator.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some errors have significant impact on the intellectual 'essence' (E.g. non embedded fonts leading to a font substitution to a sub-par font, resulting in the visual loss of special characters (eg maconised chars such as &quot;ā&quot; or &quot;ō&quot;)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, some errors do result in an inability to render the file (not the case here, but worth acknowledging), e.g. missing EOF maybe because of an incomplete file transfer resulting in a partial file that is missing binary data. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a practical perspective, we've been encountering this issue for a number of years as we ingest files into our preservation system. Initially we noted every instance that we encountered. This resulted in some nice data that showed this issue (of JHOVE failing pdf) is found across all pdf types that get ingested, and at a anecdotal rate of about 1 in every ~250 being flagged by JHOVE as having an issue of some sort. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We currently programatically ignore the flag from JHOVE if we can render the file. If we can render the file, we assume complete fail, and look into the file specifically. When we ignore the flag, a record is keep that a file was given an error by JHOVE, but the file is allowed to proceed unhindered into the perm storage. By ignoring the flag, we are essentially making a statement of intent that says &quot;We acknowledge there is a potential risk with this file - we are currently unable to isolate the specific reason for the error, nor diagnose any specific long term risk for the content of the file. We will return at some point to the issue when either (1) we are sufficiently equipped with tools to address the challenge, (2) we have raised the generic risk against the pdf file type high enough that it becomes our priority action to explore/fix/mitigate or (c) we have run out of other things to do...&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a principle. we would always retain the original file as it was first deposited - regardless of the ability to create a 'cleaner' version. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Its also worth thinking about what the constraining factor hear actually is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is the threshold test for creating a 'valid' digital object. On the one hand we have &quot;Conforms to the exact specification&quot;(JHOVE) on the other &quot;Functions as expected across a representational set of object renderers&quot; (Renderability test).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This notion of validity is at the very heart of what we are trying to achieve here, and I think personally that validity is not a binary thing (either valid, or not valid), there is a huge grey area in the middle that we work in on a daily basis and often we have to err on one side or another because of systematic/programmatic/circumstantial factors, when sometimes the decision might be better left on hold to allow knowledge and experience to influence the decision when its crunch time...

Whilst its not a core DP role perhaps, its takes a DBA a decent amount of knowledge to understand the specific preservation based questions and functions that are needed in a DP system - a good example is the notion of managing a moving hash value (object A comes in with hash A, preservation function occurs and object is changed, resulting a new object (B) and thus in hash A and hash B relating to the same intellectual object. Anything that happens to object A must be reflected in someway with object B, and so these things are abstractly but intrinsically linked - its a small example, but an example none the less of how a traditional DBA needs some additional models to work from.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Technical Content Specialist** - Someone who can tell you what is important from a technical perspective about any digital object you encounter. Needs a very diverse set of skills (arguably the most important one is good google-fu...) some comprehension of what information contained inside a digital object (primary and meta), what standards are for file / information types and how to tell if something does meet a standard, what to do with invalid digital objects, managing / recording / explaining what the holding institution knows about the digital object (e.g. does this TIF image contain GIS information in the XMP sidecar, if so, what does it point to?), a list of other technical functions that could be asked at any time to help the holding institution collect, appraise, record and store digital things (including assessing and dealing with unknown bitstreams....) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Preservation Action Specialist** - Someone who is responsible for the preservation functions. Migrations, access copy generations, any emulation platform, interpretations of objects, creation of groups of objects that can be worked on together, knowing how to tell that story to content owners / guardians so they can be comfortable with any actions being undertaken, informing policy, reporting on processes, keeping informed etc etc... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Preservation Policy Specialist** - Someone to handles the internal policy side of ensuring that preservation activities are properly codified, documented and aligned with other business units and they handle the theoretical  / philosophical concerns and considerations of preservation management.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I put the policy role at the least technical side of the technical roles. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the contextual side, I'd have to say its the usual library, museums and archive functions (records management, collection planning, collecting, curating, indexing, cataloging etc) but in a way that is (1) digitally savvy and (2) preservation aware.

Text="Michael von Groenendyk, who helped set up a maker space at a Canadian university library was helpful enough to help me with similar questions and I've copied his reply below.  I've also emailed him to see if he can answer directly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;The minimum a library would need to set up their own Maker Space would be around $1000 [£650]. 3D printers can be bought for as low as $500 US now, a little cheaper than that if you are willing to put one together yourself using a do-it-yourself kit. Most average hobby-grade 3D printers are priced the $1000-3000 US range. You start seeing higher quality in 3D printers after the $20,000 price point, but this is far too expensive for the majority of public libraries to afford.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For plastic filament costs (or what the 3D printer prints builds objects with), in my experience, having a hobby grade 3D printer printing non-stop 24 hours a day will use about $60 worth of plastic over one month. The plastic commonly used with hobby-grade 3D printers is either ABS (Lego) or PLA (bio-degradable corn based) plastic. With higher-end 3D printers these costs easily triple. The costs of plastic filament increase with non-hobbyist 3D printers such as 3D Systems Cubify 3D printer, which force their owners to buy plastic filament from a fixed supplier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once they’re up and running hobby grade 3D printers do not involve that much staff time. Throughout a day a public library could expect to have a single staff member spend about an hour of time working with their 3D printer. The problem with hobby grade 3D printers, though, is that they break down, and when this happens unexpectedly (and it will happen soon or later) this can quickly become a drain on staff resources. The time it takes to set up and learn how to use a 3D printer can be a time consuming process as well, typically requiring around 2 weeks of intensive work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many other building tools are featured in Maker Spaces besides 3D printers, such as laser cutters and computer numeric controlled (CNC) machines, which work much like 3D printers in that they can turn a digital 3D model into a physical object. Most of these machines are dangerous to operate, however, and are priced in the $20,000-$40,000 US range, and so are unsuitable for most public libraries.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope that begins to help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Then, if they're being used frequently, the plastic (ABS or PLA) will cast an additional $100-$200 US a month. A good source for hobby grade 3D printers is [Make Magazine's: Ultimate Guide to 3D Printing][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Higher end 3D printers start at $10,000 US (such as Stratasys' Mojo printer) and run up to the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The material costs are much more expensive too, and the 3D prints after require additional cleaning, commonly by blasting them with compressed water. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The higher end 3D printers produce much better prints than the hobby grades, but they are much more expensive to maintain. The prints themselves are much more expensive too.

Hobby grade 3D printers especially require a lot of staff time.

Hobby grade 3D printers are much more difficult to make publicly available. It is very easy to damage these machines, and very difficult to repair them.

There's a number of models freely available on Thingiverse.com but to really have a MakerSpace 3D design skills need to be promoted in some way.

I have done a lot of work with CBCL Ltd. Consulting Engineers, who have been extremely helpful in providing additional funding. Then in exchange we are able to provide them lost cost 3D printing, and a better exchange of ideas between engineering students. There is a lot of interest in 3D printing technology and, in my experience, it has not been very difficult finding professional organizations willing to invest money into library makerspaces.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have considering providing other makerspace tools outside of 3D printers, such as CNC machines and laster cutters, but it is difficult bringing these in due to noise and safety issues, and because of this they would need constant staff supervision.

Then, if they're being used frequently, the plastic (ABS or PLA) will cost an additional $100-$200 US a month. A good source for hobby grade 3D printer information is [Make Magazine's: Ultimate Guide to 3D Printing][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Higher end 3D printers start at $10,000 US (such as Stratasys' Mojo printer) and run up to the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The material costs are much more expensive too, and the 3D prints often require additional cleaning, most commonly by blasting them with compressed water. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The higher end 3D printers produce much better prints than the hobby grades, but they are much more expensive to maintain. 3D prints rarely fail on these machines though, a problem that will quickly turn into extreme frustration when working with hobby grade 3D printers. The 3D prints themselves are much more expensive too, in a large part due to closed 3D printing material sources (the big 3D printing companies such as 3D Systems and Stratasys have traditionally run a &quot;Razor &amp; Blade&quot; business model for their 3D printing consumables). As such the higher end 3D printers would be more suited to a library that knows the 3D printers will be used by professionals such as architects or engineers. Otherwise, if they are just opening up 3D printing to a patron base not familiar with them, the costs of 3D printing with a hobby grade printer will be much more attractive, which has been my experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are definitely staffing issues involved with having a 3D printer. Hobby grade 3D printers especially require a lot of staff time. There are always misprints, prints will fall of the build platform, plastic will get clogged, etc., and it can be very time consuming to fix and maintain these 3D printers, which again has been my experience with them. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Professional grade 3D printers run without much of a need for staff involvement, outside the cleaning process. I have worked with these quite a bit too, and I can say this from experience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Professional grade 3D printers are also more enclosed and easier to open to the public. Hobby grade 3D printers are much more difficult to make publicly available. It is very easy to damage these machines, and very difficult to repair them. If a hobby grade 3D printer is made available it should definitely be in an area where staff can monitor it and ensure that patrons are not putting their hands inside of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By providing a 3D printer to library patrons, an important issue to address is 3D modelling skills. There's a number of models freely available on Thingiverse.com but to really have a makerspace, 3D design skills need to be promoted in some way. There are a few good, free programs available such as TinkerCAD and Google Sketchup, but this is a very difficult issue to overcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would definitely recommend trying to partner with professional organizations in this. I have done a lot of work with CBCL Ltd. Consulting Engineers, who have been extremely helpful in providing additional funding. Then in return we are able to provide them with low cost 3D printing, and a better exchange of ideas between engineering students. There is a lot of interest in 3D printing technology and, in my experience, it has not been very difficult finding professional organizations willing to invest money into library makerspaces.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have considered providing other makerspace tools outside of 3D printers, such as CNC machines and laser cutters, but it is difficult bringing these into a library setting due to noise and safety issues, and because of this they would need constant staff supervision. Right now we do have a laser scanner available that can work in relation to the 3D printer. The tools you can provide really depends on your space and how your patrons would want to use it.

Most of them even incorporate the same software like DROID. The major differences that I've found are in the storage of metadata and the granularity of user permissions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Metadata Storage ###&#xD;&#xA;First, one of the larger differences you'll see right now is the use of databases to record metadata. Alot of individual tools generate a METS/PREMIS object to contain the technical (format, file specifications, etc), administrative (copyright, etc) and descriptive metadata for each object or group of objects it processes. Digital preservation environments like Archivematica, Ex Libris Rosetta, and Tessella System Preservica/SDB also place this information into a database.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Using a database allows you to hook up your archive to a search system more easily and, I think most importantly, it gives you better control over future preservation actions. For instance, you can run a report to return a list of all the formats you're holding. Then, when you identify a format you'd like to migrate, you can search for a list of those specific files. The metadata and database should then track whatever preservation actions you perform on those objects. Note that it's probably safer to maintain both the metadata object and the database to guard against either becoming disassociated from the preserved objects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### User Permissions ###&#xD;&#xA;Second, commercial systems often include more complex systems for defining user access. Rosetta and SDB/Preservica both allow administrators to restrict actions like ingest, preservation, and metadata editing to certain classes of users, and will record the ID of users that perform these actions. Restricting access increases the security of files and builds greater provenance. However, this feature is not as necessary for smaller organizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Edit 2013/03/04: Thanks to Artefactual Systems for clearing up an error on my part." />

Of the two FOXML seems an easier to target transformation, all else being equal. So yes - you'd need to run XSL on your exported ePrints records, or have some other way to convert them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Regarding your file attachment situation: do other systems or software reference the current locations of these files? If so, then it strikes me you will lean toward preserving their current directory locations, and have Fedora manage them as **[externally referenced content][1]**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If not, and ePrints is the only system referencing these locations, it strikes me as easier to group these files alongside the new FOXML files you'll be generating, so that Fedora can manage them in its asset store as it will as **[managed datatreams][2]**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Having a stable, efficient testing routine is fundamental to your sanity. These sorts of projects are epic (before you know it, you'll be undertaking metadata normalization as part of your XML transformation workflow, etc.) so slow, methodical steps in a backed-up environment are key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fedora is incredibly flexible and powerful but also quite complex as far as asset management systems go.

Nevertheless, my thoughts on your project:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - I believe all ingested content for Fedora must be accompanied by either a FOXML or METS `.xml` file so that it can be managed according to Fedora's digital object model. Of the two FOXML seems an easier to target transformation, all else being equal. So yes - you'd need to run XSL on your exported ePrints records, or have some other way to convert them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Regarding your file attachment situation: do other systems or software reference the current locations of these files? If so, then it strikes me you will lean toward preserving their current directory locations, and have Fedora manage them as **[externally referenced content][1]**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; If not, and ePrints is the only system referencing these locations, it strikes me as easier to group these files alongside the new FOXML files you'll be generating, so that Fedora can manage them in its asset store as it will as **[managed datatreams][2]**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Having a stable, efficient testing routine is fundamental to your sanity. These sorts of projects are epic (before you know it, you'll be undertaking metadata normalization as part of your XML transformation workflow, etc.) so slow, methodical steps in a backed-up environment are key.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fedora is incredibly flexible and powerful but also quite complex as far as asset management systems go.

In many cases PDF/A support has been integrated into (document management and other) systems and programs (like office applications), there are lots of options to do checking and conversion on all platforms, desktop systems and servers. An overview can be found on the website of the PDF Association at www.pdfa.org.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All in all PDF (ISO 32000-1:2008), or preferably PDF/A (ISO 19005 series), is a very reasonable option when it comes to archiving final form, static, 2-dimensional documents. Personally I do not believe any other format comes even close for this type of content/documents for long term preservation, but your mileage may vary. For other types of content/documents, other formats or approaches may be more suitable.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Firstly, for formats that are known to support encryption (e.g. [PDF][1], [ePub][2], ZIP, etc.), you might expect that characterisation tools can report the presence of encryption. This is true, but in practice many of the tools perform poorly because encryption is used in two ways: as well as full encryption (requiring a specific password to unpack a bytestream), encryption can be used to support obfuscation (where the encryption algorithm does not require a password, or only requires a known, shared, password). For example, PDF uses a default empty string password in some cases, and the JHOVE characterisation tool cannot distinguish between this and full encryption.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second way of answering this question is as follows - are there any ways of spotting encryption *in general*, i.e. without understanding the format of the bytestream. The answer to this appears to be 'sometimes'. Methods such as the visualisation of [bytestream entropy][3] have been [used to spot encrypted regions of files][4], and so this kind of information-theoretical analysis may be useful in some cases. Formally, however, encryption is statistically indistinguishable from compression, and therefore this approach will lead to a lot of false-positives in the presence of compressed data.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There appear to be very few established tools that perform these tasks.&#xD;&#xA; [1]: http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/PDF#Digital_Rights_Management_.26_Encryption&#xD;&#xA; [2]: http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/EPUB#Digital_Rights_Management_.26_Encryption&#xD;&#xA; [3]: http://troydhanson.github.com/misc/Entropy.html&#xD;&#xA; [4]: http://corte.si/posts/visualisation/entropy/&#xD;&#xA;" />

While this does not help you right this minute, there has been some discussion in the past of using emulated environments to do this sort of testing.  Under such a model the format and interaction software of the file(s) would be submitted to an emulator which would configure itself to boot that software and open the file(s). The result of this process would be analysed to see if it included a password input or decryption requirement. The whole process could be automated and set to iterate across a large set of files without manual input. This process would require very similar technology to that included in the [Migration by Emulation Service][1] developed as part of the Open Planets Foundation work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such a tool does assume a certain degree of knowledge of the software needed to interact with the files and this may limit its applicability.

Some of those sites are free, while others will charge for retrieval of the documents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What they don't seem to mention is [public.resource.org](https://public.resource.org/), a project that's been paying to get public records that are behind paywalls, and making them freely available.  As PACER is always growing, I doubt they have a 100% complete record, but as the charges are for printing at the end, it should be possible to do a search on PACER, and then check resource.org's PACER archive to see if they already have a copy.

Text="Michael von Groenendyk, who helped set up a maker space at a Canadian university library was helpful enough to help me with similar questions and I've copied his reply below.  I've also emailed him to see if he can answer directly. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;The minimum a library would need to set up their own Maker Space would be around $1000 [£650]. 3D printers can be bought for as low as $500 US now, a little cheaper than that if you are willing to put one together yourself using a do-it-yourself kit. Most average hobby-grade 3D printers are priced the $1000-3000 US range. You start seeing higher quality in 3D printers after the $20,000 price point, but this is far too expensive for the majority of public libraries to afford.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For plastic filament costs (or what the 3D printer prints builds objects with), in my experience, having a hobby grade 3D printer printing non-stop 24 hours a day will use about $60 worth of plastic over one month. The plastic commonly used with hobby-grade 3D printers is either ABS (Lego) or PLA (bio-degradable corn based) plastic. With higher-end 3D printers these costs easily triple. The costs of plastic filament increase with non-hobbyist 3D printers such as 3D Systems Cubify 3D printer, which force their owners to buy plastic filament from a fixed supplier.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Once they’re up and running hobby grade 3D printers do not involve that much staff time. Throughout a day a public library could expect to have a single staff member spend about an hour of time working with their 3D printer. The problem with hobby grade 3D printers, though, is that they break down, and when this happens unexpectedly (and it will happen soon or later) this can quickly become a drain on staff resources. The time it takes to set up and learn how to use a 3D printer can be a time consuming process as well, typically requiring around 2 weeks of intensive work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Many other building tools are featured in Maker Spaces besides 3D printers, such as laser cutters and computer numeric controlled (CNC) machines, which work much like 3D printers in that they can turn a digital 3D model into a physical object. Most of these machines are dangerous to operate, however, and are priced in the $20,000-$40,000 US range, and so are unsuitable for most public libraries.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope that begins to help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Ie, this cleans up the potential hiding spaces on the device. This does not clean up the current slack space associated with live files. Ie, a 512 byte file on a filesystem with 32KB clusters would represent some 31.5KB of potential slack space data, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Once the free space on the disk has been zero'd out, you would then copy the existing files to another location on the drive. However, to avoid the slack space issue, you may want to consider which program you use to copy your files from one location to another. Presuming a program like &quot;rsync&quot; is only copying data that is part of the live file, you can just rsync the data from one folder to another folder on the device. Since all of the other free space has been zero'd out, there is no new data containing slack space that will be generated.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3) Once your files have been copied, delete the original files and re-perform step #1 to wipe out the newly created &quot;dirty&quot; unused space. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once you complete the above steps, you will have a drive with the data files you want to send/leave, and all slack space will have been zeroed out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You HAVE to do a full disk zero wipe of the free space to ensure that no new data bearing slack space is created.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, updated instructions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    # Go into the mounted filesystem&#xD;&#xA;    cd /Volume/MountedFileSystem/&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    # Wipe the free space on the disk&#xD;&#xA;    dd if=/dev/zero of=./junk-file-containing-zeroes.dat bs=1000000&#xD;&#xA;    rm junk-file-containing-zeroes.dat&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    # create a tar file containing just the data you want to send.&#xD;&#xA;    tar cfPp ./datafiles.tar ./&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    # Delete the original files containing dirty slackspace&#xD;&#xA;    rm YourFilesAndFoldersButNotThatTarFile&#xD;&#xA;    &#xD;&#xA;    # Wipe up that new dirty space you just created!!

Ie, this cleans up the potential hiding spaces on the device. This does not clean up the current slack space associated with live files. Ie, a 512 byte file on a filesystem with 32KB clusters would represent some 31.5KB of potential slack space data, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2) Once the free space on the disk has been zero'd out, you would then copy the existing files to another location on the drive. However, to avoid the slack space issue, you may want to consider which program you use to copy your files from one location to another. Presuming a program like &quot;rsync&quot; is only copying data that is part of the live file, you can just rsync the data from one folder to another folder on the device.

In our catalog, for example, there is a column in the search results which can be toggled between date added (year only) and copyright. You can click on the column heading to sort. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In testing this, I looked at *Hunger Games*, since I knew we had multiple copies, that those copies are regularly replaced so would have different purchase dates, and that individual holdings do not show up in the catalog (so only one date would show up). So what date would it choose? It chose the date the bibliographic record was created! This is not a MARC field, but something that is created by our ILS. Very helpful too, as the data is available until the bibliographic record is deleted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next I looked at the Library of Congress. Their catalog search result listing only shows the copyright date, so I couldn't sort, but when I pulled up an individual item record, and looked at the MARC record, I noticed that LOC had created a MARC field 955 for acquisition dates - as far as I know 955 is not an official MARC tag.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To your other question - *is it possible to use catalog library data to understand the composition of a libraries collection at different periods of time—say in 1850 versus in 1900?* That answer would be No, since the MARC record system was only developed in 1960 (by the LOC), and only adopted by libraries as they became computerized over the next 4 decades. I don't think you are going to find searchable computerized data on historical library holdings. And since most libraries other than perhaps the LOC probably do not keep bibliographic records of weeded items, you probably won't get that kind of information in the future about today's libraries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

In your example, the book is more about science than about history, so you would probably put it in science. Most books when published have a cataloging page in them (on the reverse of the title page) that is usually prepared by the Library of Congress prior to publication. It will list the subjects of the book in order of prominence. There is usually an assigned Dewey classification as well which will indicate where a professional cataloger thought the book should go (science being in the 500s and history in the 900s). If there is no cataloging page, you can find cataloging information through the World Catalog (WorldCat) or the Library of Congress for most books.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In your own collection, you are of course not bound to the decisions of the catalogers who have pre-classified the book. In a library, the cataloger on staff may choose to move books to a location that makes more sense to the public being served. For example, books about space are in the 500s (science), books about rockets are in the 600s (engineering) and books about travel to extraterrestrial places are in the 900s (travel). A browser might expect all these books to be together, so a public library will often put them all in science so they are together on the shelf.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is an imperfect system to be sure, especially since the Dewey Decimal system predates a lot of current technology and has built-in biases based on the time it was created.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Technically, using Dewey, you could still classify them in [625 (engineering of railroads &amp; roads)](http://dewey.info/class/625/2009-07/about.en) vs. [385 (commerce : railway transportation)](http://dewey.info/class/385/e23/2012-10-24/about.en), and there's range within those categories.  ... but you might decide instead to focus on some secondary attributes instead -- maybe country or region that the book focus on ... or time period if you're more interested in the history of trains.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The important thing is that if you're shelving for yourself, you just have to put them where *you* are likely to think about when you're trying to find them again.  You might decide that Dewey works for you, or [BISAC](http://www.bisg.org/what-we-do-0-136-bisac-subject-headings-list-major-subjects---2009-edition.php), or some specialized taxonomy, or come up with one yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I have a lot of cookbooks ... so I focus on how I think of the cookbooks.  I have beginner cookbooks (because I specifically collect those), community cookbooks, more encyclopedic cookbooks (to include the time-life series that my mom has decided to attempt to fill in for me), specific regions or cultures (some of which are the community cookbooks), those that focus on a tool (eg, crockpot) or a specific result (eg, pancakes, paella, casseroles, cookies) or ingredient (hot peppers, garlic, chocolate), etc.  And I have the bookcase just outside my kithen that I use more frequently.  Which leads to the gardening books, then the landscaping books, which follows the architecture books.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />
