This eliminates a lot of the concerns regarding preservation of the &quot;only&quot; physical copy, and can even eliminate the need for an ILL request. Access permissions (you guessed it) can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In summary: since restrictions vary, either contact your local library's ILL librarian, or research the matter on the lending library's web site (try the pages intended for other libraries or those intended for students depositing their thesis).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also have good luck contacting the student directly.

It is commonly used in research and academic libraries. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcc.html&quot;&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; website explains: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The system divides all knowledge into twenty-one basic classes, each&#xA;  identified by a single letter of the alphabet. Most of these&#xA;  alphabetical classes are further divided into more specific&#xA;  subclasses, identified by two-letter, or occasionally three-letter,&#xA;  combinations. For example, class N, Art, has subclasses NA,&#xA;  Architecture; NB, Sculpture, ND, Painting; as well as several other&#xA;  subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement&#xA;  of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the&#xA;  more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific&#xA;  places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals,&#xA;  biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is&#xA;  assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in&#xA;  LCC may range from one to four digits in length, and may be further&#xA;  extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in&#xA;  alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by&#xA;  decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral ,&#xA;  e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by&#xA;  the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics&#xA;  under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/nlmclassif.html&quot;&gt;NLM classification&lt;/a&gt; that is used more often in medical libraries. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The NLM Classification covers the field of medicine and related&#xA;  sciences. The scheme is a system of classification intended to be used&#xA;  for the shelf arrangement of all library materials, regardless of&#xA;  format. Designed as a broad classification, it is suitable for both&#xA;  large and small library collections and may be adapted to handle&#xA;  specialized collections of any size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The NLM Classification is a system of mixed notation patterned after&#xA;  the Library of Congress (LC) Classification where alphabetical letters&#xA;  which denote broad subject categories are further subdivided by&#xA;  numbers. The NLM Classification utilizes schedules QS-QZ and W-WZ,&#xA;  permanently excluded from the LC Classification Schedules and is&#xA;  intended to be used with the LC schedules which supplement the NLM&#xA;  Classification for subjects bordering on medicine and for general&#xA;  reference materials. The LC schedules for Human Anatomy (QM),&#xA;  Microbiology (QR), and Medicine (R) are not used at all by the&#xA;  National Library of Medicine since they overlap the NLM&#xA;  Classification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bisg.org/activities-programs/activity.php?n=d&amp;amp;id=73&amp;amp;cid=20&quot;&gt;BISAC system&lt;/a&gt;, which is used mainly for booksellers, but also has been adapted for library use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The BISAC Subject Headings List, also known as the BISAC Subject Codes&#xA;  List, is a standard used by many companies throughout the supply chain&#xA;  to categorize books based on topical content. The Subject Heading&#xA;  applied to a book can determine where the work is shelved in a brick&#xA;  and mortar store or the genre(s) under which it can be searched for in&#xA;  an internal database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.udcc.org/about.htm&quot;&gt;Universal Decimal Classification&lt;/a&gt; system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is the world's foremost&#xA;  multilingual classification scheme for all fields of knowledge, a&#xA;  sophisticated indexing and retrieval tool. It was adapted by Paul&#xA;  Otlet (Rayward's Otlet page; Wikipedia entry ) and Nobel Prizewinner&#xA;  Henri La Fontaine from the Decimal Classification of Melvil Dewey, and&#xA;  first published (in French) between 1904 and 1907. Since then, it has&#xA;  been extensively revised and developed, and has become a highly&#xA;  flexible and effective system for organizing bibliographic records for&#xA;  all kinds of information in any medium (it is well suited to&#xA;  multi-media information collections). It is structured in such a way&#xA;  that new developments and new fields of knowledge can be readily&#xA;  incorporated. The code itself is independent of any particular&#xA;  language or script (consisting of arabic numerals and common&#xA;  punctuation marks), and the accompanying class descriptions have&#xA;  appeared in many translated versions. UDC is in worldwide use, and has&#xA;  been published in whole or in part in 40 different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also various classification systems in other languages, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Library_Classification&quot;&gt;Chinese Library Classification&lt;/a&gt;, and the Russian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiana.edu/~libslav/slavcatman/bbkover.html&quot;&gt;BBK Classification&lt;/a&gt; System.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2012-05-22T20:33:24.987" />

Keep bookcases&#xA;  clean by vacuuming and shaking out books.  Don’t allow piles of old&#xA;  papers and magazines to accumulate.  Check old books before bringing&#xA;  them into the house.  Store starched linens in sealed plastic bags. &#xA;  Seal cracks and crevices with caulking compound to reduce the number&#xA;  of hiding places. Make the environment less attractive by reducing the&#xA;  humidity with a dehumidifier. Anhydrous calcium carbonate, a&#xA;  dehydrating agent, is effective in removing moisture from the air in&#xA;  closets and other small spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also chemical solutions to silverfish problems, but those can also harm the books and other materials - these solutions are best left to people with more expertise in these things, especially where a library collection is concerned. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="22" LastActivityDate="2012-05-22T20:52:48.690" />

Here are the assumptions I'm working from (correct me if any are wrong):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The charge is set and cannot be changed at this juncture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The group is supposed to feed new projects and/or services back into the rest of the staff (as opposed to a Clayton Christensen-style independent offshoot).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Process&lt;/em&gt; would be my first Big Question. Who suggests ideas to the innovation committee, and how do they do it? Once an idea is on the table, how does the committee make a yea-or-nay decision on it, and who has (de facto or de jure) veto power on a yea decision? Are promising ideas piloted? How? For how long? How are pilot projects assessed for promotion to standard library services? Must all changes the library or any segment thereof are contemplating feed through this committee? If not, which changes do and which don't?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(It needs to be clear from the outset that pilot-project failure is not only an option, it's an &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt;. The only alternatives to that are bad ones: only the blandest, timidest ideas survive, or ideas that are bad or unworkable for whatever reason but still make it through the committee never manage to die. Fail, sweep up after the failure, move on with analysis but sans blame.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Committee membership&lt;/em&gt; would be my second Big Question. I've seen &quot;innovation committees&quot; that were cliques. I've seen ones whose members were honestly desirous of innovating, but whose excluded colleagues believed the committee was a clique, or felt excluded for other reasons (&quot;nobody from [x library division] is on that group, so clearly they don't care what we think!&quot;). I've seen some with no members from management; they came up with wonderful ideas but had no authority or resources to put them in practice. This is a hard political problem; one way to attack it is to rotate membership on innovation committees, so that no one gets entrenched and everyone gets heard. Alternately, for each proposal, figure out which sections of staff would be affected and put a representative from each affected section on the project group for that specific project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change management&lt;/em&gt; would be my third Big Question. There's no point in starting a think tank if it's surrounded by immovable cement roadblocks... and that's as far as I'm willing to take that metaphor. Is the think tank responsible for selling an innovation? To whom (administration, staff, patrons)? What happens when the think tank has to deal with unjustified change resistance (n.b. not all change resistance is unjustified)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Good luck.

So they can check out books, search the catalog, find out your hours, etc. all from the convenience of their mobile phone. Many of these tasks are difficult if not impossible for mobile users on a desktop website; mobile screens are so small &amp;amp; struggle with basic navigational features (tiny link text, drop-down menus) that most would give up rather than continue on their way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the real question is: &lt;em&gt;what is the advantage of a native library app over a mobile website&lt;/em&gt;. That answer is less clear. The tasks that both Kode and Jeanne name (locations, hours, phone numbers, calendars, catalogue searches, placing holds, &amp;amp; look up hours, titles, reserve books) do not require any special native technology. A mobile website would suit these fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, I don't think a native app is a good choice if you're not going to use the advantages of the native platform: are you planning to tap into device APIs? Do you need persistent storage (hint: none of the actions above do)? Would the app often be used offline? Does your site use the camera? If the answer to those is no, then you're creating more problems that solutions with an app. App's have to versioned: you'll need &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; an Android and an iOS one, but other OSes can always gain market share (Windows Phone, BlackBerry, etc.) and backwards compatibility can break with OS upgrades. A mobile website renders across devices fine; one could, for instance, employ &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquerymobile.com/&quot;&gt;jQuery Mobile&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that a site runs across &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/&quot;&gt;all major devices&lt;/a&gt;. You also need to pay fees to have apps listed in proprietary, closed markets like the App Store whereas the web is open and accessible to all. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, HTML5 is rapidly narrowing the gap between native applications on both desktop and mobile operating systems and the capabilities of the web. I would also argue that the skills for developing mobile-optimized websites (generally HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) are more common than the ones for native apps (mostly Objective C on iOS, mostly Java on Android, though both can use WebKit views to run apps written in web languages like the Facebook iOS app does).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know it's awful to say &quot;let me answer the question you should have asked&quot; but I feel like the difference between apps &amp;amp; websites often goes unarticulated. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/apps-vs-the-web/&quot;&gt;A List Apart&lt;/a&gt; has a nice overview of the differences for those who want to look into this further.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="136" LastActivityDate="2012-05-23T02:27:50.863" CommentCount="3" />

Most archives don't have the luxury of empty shelving awaiting new fonds (a person's archives), and the nature of archives and archival operations makes it difficult to weed out materials (deaccession) that have already been formally acquired by an archives (archival principles such as the archival bond and the principle of provenance, and administrative hurdles such as donor agreements are some of the challenges to deaccession). Most archives don't have the staff hours necessary to process and provide access to the materials it accepts. This necessarily limits the number of faculty fonds a university archives can accept, so the archives will have to consider, amongst other factor, the relationship between the faculty member and the university and the contributions the faculty member has made to his/her field when deciding whether his/her fonds will be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the faculty member's fonds is accepted, the archives will need to conduct an archival appraisal to determine which records hold the most archival value (which records provide evidence of significant transactions, which records contain the most informational value, etc.). For some records, laws on privacy make deposit in an archives unfeasible—in most jurisdictions, legislation places additional requirements on protection of privacy in medical and student records (in the United States, for example, these areas fall under HIPAA and FERPA, respectively). Some records duplicate information found in another record in a more efficient or effective form (final versions vs. drafts, or a course syllabus that describes major assignments, rather than the description sheets for each assignment). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Archival appraisal is always a balancing act between a desire to preserve the integrity of a person's fonds while recognizing an archives' inability to preserve everything and there is no international standard available to guide archivists on how to proceed.

This is especially popular with 2- and 3-year-olds. To avoid a stampede, it can be helpful to form kids into a circle and blow bubbles toward each child. Some people sing &quot;Goodbye Bubble&quot; during this (it helps create a sense of ending, especially when the song stops), but you could skip the song, simply speak the words, have the parents sing it, or play a recorded version. (To the tune of &lt;em&gt;Frere Jacques&lt;/em&gt;: Goodbye bubbles, goodbye bubbles; Time to go, time to go; I will help you, I will help you; With a blow, with a blow.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toys, scarves or activities&lt;/strong&gt;: Some storytimes end by transitioning into a free play period, sometimes with coloring sheets, crafts, toys, or scarves to play with.

I think the answer to your question reflects organizational realities more than technological ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The libraries I've worked in had an entire department devoted to MARC cataloging. Anything else lived in the wainscoting -- the impoverished digital library, or the starved, staggering, scorned institutional repository. Whatever Those People Over There did, to a cataloger, was &quot;non-MARC data,&quot; and you'd better believe it wasn't as important or as professional as MARC. Were Those People Over There &lt;em&gt;even librarians&lt;/em&gt;? Some catalogers said not, frankly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(There's a strain of rhetoric in the &quot;whither libraries?&quot; literature that bolsters this organizational dysfunction: it holds that MARC is one of librarianship's central mysteries, such that veering away from it means abandoning librarianship altogether. Michael Gorman and Martha Yee write in this mode, among others.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world is changing, of course. &quot;Non-MARC data,&quot; even if we just consider it &quot;library-created or library-held metadata in a form other than MARC,&quot; probably outweighs MARC data bit for bit by now. (This is a mildly unfair comparison, because MARC was designed for economy of storage, and XML was not. Even so.) Measuring by current-processing output, non-MARC data probably gives MARC a run for its money these days, considering how mainstream digitization has become, and how relatively simple and automatable it is to create much non-MARC data compared to MARC/AACR2/ISBD. (I grant you, PREMIS is a bear.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the linguistic markedness of MARC (see what I did there?) doesn't reflect production volume or holdings volume, much less a measure of impact on patrons or on the world.

There should exist a cataloging interface that is intuitive enough to handle simple cases without the user knowing AACR or even that the system uses MARC internally (if it does).

That is, everything you create is a liability of going out of date, so unless you have to give particularly important information about configuring a tool for use at your organization or unless your users have particularly distinct needs from other users I would suggest that you first try and point out to high quality guides and documentation that exist elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I worked on Zotero I spent a good bit of time reading a lot of the guides that libraries provided. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zotero.org/support/third_party_documentation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Here are some examples of different approaches libraries took&lt;/a&gt;.

A mobile friendly site can alleviate this with the most essential information quickly, hours of operation, current events, catalog link, reference question link.

I took a &quot;lifecycle&quot; approach to our guide, and you can check it out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lib.msu.edu/about/diginfo/ldmp.jsp&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I met with some colleagues and we felt this was a really &quot;reactive&quot; approach. We formed a small interest group called DIG (yes, &quot;Data Interest Group&quot;), and out of that group we decided to take the issue to our library colleagues via a presentation and discussion which you can find &lt;a href=&quot;http://staff.lib.msu.edu/mooneyh/myresearch/DemystifyingDataAndScholarlyCommunication.pptx&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discussion was especially fruitful, and we decided to meet again. We invited some library colleagues to our meeting and held discussion of more proactive models for engaging our faculty. The primary outcome was the formation of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lib.msu.edu/about/rdmg/index.jsp&quot;&gt;Research Data Management Guidance&lt;/a&gt; team. This group has been instrumental in many spinoff projects including:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Face-to-face consultation on writing data management plans&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Presenting to our New Faculty Orientation and our Faculty Seminar series&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Presenting to graduate classes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We felt this was a good step, but again--nothing novel. We continued our DIG meetings and tried to drum up a way to have a broader impact--outside of the library. We were aware of an administrative level task force that was looking at some of the larger issues that would challenge the university, but there was little activity on the ground level. We also knew that there were other &quot;worker bee&quot; people like us siloed away in other departments and units, so we decided to reach out to all of the research service providers across campus to invite them to a kind of Meet N' Greet where we could eat bagels and swap stories. It turned out that all of these people were interested in learning about ways to improve the research data services they offered and also advocating for the services of others (e.g. statistical consulting, high performance computing, departmental storage...).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, out of that meeting came two outcomes: the first was to continue our conversation by regularly meeting (quarterly) and to develop a referral network based around the concept of a 'service catalog.' These two outcomes are currently in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess I should say what I learned from this process:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The best way to get engaged is to do the engaging. I've definitely had more consultations as a follow up to a presentation than the website has brought in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Form an interest group. Make it a working group, not a committee.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reach out to other service providers.

If there are 500 searches and only 10 downloads, that means users aren't finding what they want in the search results -- or that they aren't able to figure out &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to download the articles they want to read.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="123" LastActivityDate="2012-06-01T00:29:42.453" />

Because of the slow rate of the mail, we do not usually send recent bestsellers or &quot;hot&quot; items through this service, because they often end up being returned late and have holds waiting. The service is run largely by volunteers who select the books based on subscribers' tastes, and supervised by a member of the reference staff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The downside of both of these services is that it can be difficult to retrieve materials once they have gone out, but the upside is definitely the ability to provide regular library services to patrons who aren't able to visit the library, without having to maintain something so cumbersome as a bookmobile.

With budget cuts looming once more, my director has presented the mayor with a plan to close two to three branches, saying that we can't keep them open with the budget as it is projected--throwing down the gauntlet, as it were.

We love working together and I don't see anyone at my branch who's a non-professional. We're all pros, simple as that. As the local tech guy, I wind up teaching the staff about tech and computer things like changes to the ILS, eBooks, and stuff like that. The thing to note is that I teach this stuff to everyone, including Pages. Why? Because I have two people who are now Library Assistants who stated as Pages. We like to &quot;grow our own&quot; people and one of the best ways to do that is to give everyone the information. When they get promoted or go on to a different branch, they've got some knowledge and skills that make them stand out from those who don't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I hold one on one training sessions with anyone who wants them. Doesn't matter what they want to learn, I'll teach them. A few days ago one of my Pages came to me and asked how to search the ILS for specific books. As a Page, she really doesn't need to do that because Pages aren't working the desk or helping people with specific book queries. But as a staff member for a public library, at the very least she wanted to know how to find books for herself. So I showed her. Does it fall within her job description to know that stuff? No. Will it help her move up if she decides to be something other than a Page? Absolutely. Isn't that what professional development is for?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, on the system level. Whenever there's a training that comes up, no matter what it is; something big at the Carnegie downtown, might be some informal session at Admin, or an all hands thing at the branch EVERYONE can go.

Are you a library assistant who would like his library to develop a program or are you a manager who wants to know how to develop library assistants to their full potential? I will try to answer from both sides, having sat on both sides in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the HR person for a library, I have to consider the needs of the library first when I hire. We try to keep a mix of part-time and full-time positions to allow for scheduling flexibility. The cost of benefits is also a concern - when your personnel budget exceeds a certain percentage of your overall budget, you become vulnerable to fluctuations in income (if our sales tax income drops, I might be forced to lay people off, and that is not something I ever want to have to do).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A third consideration is succession planning. Whenever we have a job opening, we start by looking at current staff job descriptions and what hats can be shifted from person to person so that each person's job gradually becomes a better match for his skills and interests. Then we advertise for someone with the skill set we are lacking. When I hire I am always looking for people who have skills beyond what I have asked for, and particularly in areas I know we are weak, even if those tasks aren't currently being hired for. I look for management interest/potential, because a lot of people I interview are not inclined toward an administrative future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the library does pay for some conference and workshop attendance, we expect that people with a professional degree should take primary responsibility for their own professional development. I expect the librarians on staff to do professional reading and to bring ideas and concerns to the table. I expect that they will contribute to projects as they are being developed, that they will apply their particular talents whenever the opportunity arises, and that they will also volunteer to do some of the grunt work when that's what is needed. I expect that they will find ways within our organization to continually hone their skills. I expect a cheerful disposition and exceptional customer service skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we have a position open, it is sometimes an opportunity for a part-time person to become a full-time person (I should state here that we currently do not have library assistant positions - we hire part-time librarians and their job title is librarian - budget concerns may cause us to to shift from this in the future). If creating a full-time position is in the best interest of the library, that position is offered to a staff person who has talents we need, who has demonstrated initiative and leadership, who has embraced his or her work at the library, and who has expressed an interest in working full-time. If it includes management responsibilities, we will usually post the job and invite current employees to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some realities from the HR side of libraries:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often libraries can only afford library assistants, and folks with&#xA;library degrees apply for and take those positions. As the HR person,&#xA;if I offer a non-degreed position, and people with degrees apply,&#xA;chances are I will hire a person with a degree.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I get a lot of applicants when I post a full-time position and relatively few for&#xA;part-time positions. If you can afford to work part-time, the system&#xA;is to your benefit. If you can afford to hire full-time, you get a lot more applicants to choose from. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are trying to break into the library world&#xA;and can find a job in a small library (they usually    pay less,&#xA;alas), you will get to build your resume faster with a    greater&#xA;variety of skills.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The library will never be as focused on you as you are.You are in the best position to direct your own career.

To make it possible to classify any book that might come into the library, a classification system has to encompass as much of the total universe of knowledge as libraries generally hold -- which is a large universe!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DDC was designed by 19th-century American Melville Dewey, and is used to organize the nonfiction shelves in most American public libraries. (You may have noticed that much fiction in American libraries doesn't use DDC; instead, it's often arranged by genre -- romance, mystery, speculative fiction -- and author.) If you think the way Dewey split up the knowledge universe:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;000 – Computer science, information and general works&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;100 – Philosophy and psychology&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;200 – Religion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;300 – Social sciences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;400 – Language&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;500 – Science (including mathematics)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;600 – Technology and applied science&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;700 – Arts and recreation&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;800 – Literature&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;900 – History and geography&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;is a trifle odd, you're not alone! It's a reflection of Dewey's 19th-century educated-gentleman sensibilities (well, except for &quot;computer science,&quot; which is obviously a later addition), and things have changed a good bit since then. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a new book comes into the library, a librarian whose specialty is cataloging skims the book to determine what it is about, then looks that subject up in a Dewey &quot;schedule&quot; (actually some rather thick books or a complex website) to work out what its Dewey call number should be. Once labeled with that number, the book goes to a shelf near neighbors on the same or a similar subject.

One of the reasons for the lack thereof is probably because it's quite uninteresting (at the moment). In the interests of transparency I can provide some rudimentary information about how the data is archived, as I have been involved in the little bit of software development LC has done around the Twitter data to date. These remarks are not meant to be an official statement from the Library of Congress, but are merely the reflections of a software developer who has worked on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;LC currently &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gnip.com/gnip-partners-libraryofcongress/&quot;&gt;receives&lt;/a&gt; the Twitter data from a third party data provider Gnip. Gnip packages up each hour's tweet and delete activity using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt&quot;&gt;BagIt&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_%28file_format%29&quot;&gt;tarred up&lt;/a&gt;, and made available on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3&quot;&gt;Amazon S3&lt;/a&gt;.

When it finds a new one it downloads the tar file, untars it, counts the number of tweets and deletes, verifies the bag, and uses an internal data transfer application to inventory and copy the bag to archival storage, after which the bag is deleted from the local filesystem. This process runs 24/7 in order to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tweet and delete data look like the JSON that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1/get/statuses/show/%3Aid&quot;&gt;Twitter API&lt;/a&gt; itself emits. We have made no effort (to date) to normalize the data using another format for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;LC has received 94 billion tweets so far, and are currently receiving (on average) 13,750,000 tweets per-hour...and the rate is still increasing. It would require a significant amount of computing power (more than the current budgetary and policy constraints currently allow for) to re-process this data.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When researchers are given access to the data it is likely that they will already be familiar with the Twitter JSON format and its documentation, so reformatting it into something else will likely get in the way of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the interests of the archival principle of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archivists.org/glossary/term_details.asp?DefinitionKey=69&quot;&gt;original order&lt;/a&gt; it seems wise to archive the data that we receive, since it seems closest to capturing the essence and context of a tweet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Like you, it isn't clear to me what format would be better than the Tweet JSON and why.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;JSON itself is unversioned, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computer.org/portal/web/computingnow/computing-conversations/-/blogs/discovering-javascript-object-notation-with-douglas-crockford&quot;&gt;according to its creator&lt;/a&gt;, will not change...ever.

There is no device I am aware of that allows the eReader app to simply remove the book when the loan has expired. The eBook will show some kind of indication that the loan period is expired and if the user tries to open it they will get some form of error message that tells them they no longer have access to the book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the eBook apps that I'm aware of do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; remove the eBook from your device because of security concerns. If an app has the power to erase something from a device, then it presents an exploit that could be used to damage data on the device. So to be on the safe side, the app makers do not have that kind of access built into their software. The apps can download and store, but they cannot remove. (At least not automatically, the user has to initiate the deletion.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's another service that kind of competes with OverDrive called &lt;a href=&quot;http://freading.com/index&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Freading&lt;/a&gt;. We use it here at my library system and it's another method of providing eBooks for our patrons. Freading is different from OverDrive in several ways but the big two are the fact that Freading doesn't really have much from the big six publishers and how Freading does downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See, with Freading, you get an allotment of tokens per week. The tokens are virtual of course but they allow you to download a limit of books per week. Here, we have four tokens per patron. Each eBook is a set number of tokens. Some are one, some are four, but you get the idea. You can download one four-token book (checks out for two weeks just like OverDrive) or you could download four one-token books. The library is paying Freading by the download so, unlike OverDrive, the eBooks are always available. No holds, no waiting, no out of stock like you see with OverDrive which has a model that's much more like a &quot;traditional&quot; library collection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Freading uses Adobe Digital Editions for authentication and they have apps for iOS and Android. However any eReader app using ADE will work with Freading too and even Freading recommends the BlueFire reader for iOS or Android. Like OverDrive, it's a two week check out and the item simply will not open after the loan period has expired. The user can remove the eBook from their device, but the app will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another difference between OverDrive and Freading is the renewal process. While neither of these services has a renewal mechanism built in, the patron can simply re-download the book from Freading at a whim if they didn't finish. With OverDrive, if the book is popular, and there's a waiting list, then that person will have to wait to finish it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="327" LastActivityDate="2012-06-05T23:01:13.340" CommentCount="3" />

It is rather simple.  Either by scheduled job, recurring check by a resident process or by checking when the software is run (or device connected), it compares the date of the downloaded content to its expiration.  Perhaps it deletes it outright, or perhaps it merely makes it inaccessible or removes it from the index/display.  The effect to the user is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously the corollary is that the data itself must be stored (and communicated) in a secure format, only made available to &quot;secure&quot; devices, the software accessing it can't be modified, etc... all the trappings of a DRM delivery chain.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both publishers and libraries are having trouble adapting to an electronic content model that doesn't need them as much or as &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; as the print model did.

A data archive that takes in web crawls may have different needs from one that takes in more infrequent data dumps from institutional sources. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is particularly important in cases where fixity checking is part of data replication systems, i.e., a LOCKSS network. Of course, they hastened to add that this must be balanced against making sure that the intervals between fixity checks do not get too long. Since validating checksums takes computation time and something like a LOCKSS network takes a fairly &quot;laidback&quot; approach to requesting server responses, an audit system can be used to ensure that fixity checks complete at the desired intervals. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SafeArchive system proposes to help with scheduling and verifying digital preservation actions like fixity checks but I'm not involved with the project nor do I have any direct experience using ArchivesSpace for this specifically (yet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="360" LastEditorUserId="360" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-06-06T17:28:26.587" LastActivityDate="2012-06-06T17:28:26.587" CommentCount="2" />

When the first request of a patron could not be fulfilled, the patron replied with a photo of the front page of the magazine in question - he had it in his hands some time ago and was by now desperately searching for an article he remembered reading to reference it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the help of another colleague it was determined that the title was of Ukrainian origin, and several attempts were made to transcribe the title from its original Cyrillic script. Eventually one of those transcriptions took hold on one of the search engines fed, and further refinements on the title could be made which made it possible to trace down that the magazine, while in Ukrainian, was actually printed and published in Toronto.&#xA;From there it was routine work to find three copies existing within Europe, and initiate an ILL loan on one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key to searching in this case was the variety on transcriptions/romanizations of the Cyrillic title.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isko.org/&quot;&gt;International Society for Knowledge Organization&lt;/a&gt; (ISKO) should provide some references, but my personal impression is that ISKO somehow lost touch to the technical development during the 1990s. For recent research in knowledge organization I better recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/&quot;&gt;Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services group&lt;/a&gt; (NKOS). Within the field of information science, knowledge organization has lost importance with the rise of information retrieval and the shift from documentation science to information science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classifications are just one kind of the systems, which knowledge organization deals with. Despite the long tradition of classification systems, I found that knowledge about these systems is often low and practical application is poor. For instance one should know about basic terms such as facet, precombination, and postcombination, instead of the simplified image of a classification as a tree. In theory, revision and evaluation should be applied regularly to classifications. In practice some libraries even fail to cleanly track classification changes and to create a simple histogram or tree-map with distribution of their holdings in the classification. One reason is the lack of availability of the classification system in a machine-readable form. For instance the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/&quot;&gt;SKOS&lt;/a&gt; ontology better fits to thesauri than to specialized classification systems and many classifications are hidden in proprietary library systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe someone else can suggest a good textbook are best practice guide to work with classifications.

And if the worry is that they will continue to check out and lose/not return items, they could be restricted from borrowing additional items but still allowed to use the public computers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Not allowing them to use the computers probably hurts them a lot more than it helps us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="374" LastActivityDate="2012-06-18T22:50:39.930" CommentCount="1" />

With the right know-how, your sys admin can create indexes for pretty much any MARC record field.  For the most part, Horizon indexes are divided into two different kinds: Browse and Keyword.  With a few exceptions, such as ISBN, there is no such thing as an &quot;Exact&quot; search.  If you are wanting to search multiple indexes at a time, you have to use keyword searches.  You can't combine browse searches together. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BASIC SEARCH (and options):&#xA;There are a couple of different ways to do more advanced searches in Horizon.  From your basic search, by pressing F2, you have access to all the browse, keyword, and exact indexes that have been setup in your search profile, which may not be all the indexes available (this is something your sys admin controls).  From here you can search one field at a time.  However, you can also add a &quot;restriction&quot; by clicking the &quot;restrict&quot; button.  The restrictions are based on item, not bib, information and thus do not correspond to the MARC record.  These are all setup by your sys admin but there may be some defaults.  We have the ability to restricted to &quot;checked in&quot; status, specific collection codes, and locations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you get your initial results, if you used a keyword index such as the &quot;General Keyword&quot; that returns titles, versus authority records, you'll also have the ability to &quot;limit&quot; your results further.  This is done by clicking the &quot;limit&quot; box on the bottom of the results page.  Limits can be tricky to use unless you understand the back-end cataloging.  They are based on the MARC record so you must use MARC codes when appropriate.  For example, if you wish to limit to English language titles, you need to put in the code &quot;eng&quot;.  Again, like everything else, the actual limit options you have are dependent on your sys admin.  Also, limits and indexes in Horizon are really stupid.  They only search for exactly what you ask them to.  For instance, reading level is often put in as a range.  However, when you search for reading level, if you enter 8, it'll only find items that have 8 in the reading field and ignore those that should include 8 such as if it's entered as 7-10.  Limits can be used on top of each other so you could, for example, first limit to autobiographies and then limit further based on number of pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EXPERT SEARCH:&#xA;The expert search is the easiest way to do multi-field searches.  You get to it by opening the basic search and then clicking the &quot;Command Mode&quot; button on the top right.  Scroll through your index options and then double click on the first index you want to use.  It will appear down below in the search command section.  Here's an example of how our author keyword search looks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;authkw: &amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;enter your search term after the colon:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;authkw: john grisham&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Horizon is case insensitive and keyword indexes don't care what order you put the terms in. HOWEVER, there is a bug in the 7.5+ version that will cause Horizon to report an error if you try to put a comma in the search term.  This was not a problem when we were on 7.3.4.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arrow past the closing greater than sign and enter your Boolean term or click one of the operator buttons. Then double click the next index you want to use.  For instance, my final query might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;authkw: john grisham&amp;gt; NOT &amp;lt;subjkw: christmas&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you're finished creating it, hit the search button.

For example:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I work in a public library. The circulations staff can manually check out materials if you provide an ID that they can use to look up your account by name and address. (Address is important; even in a small suburb, there will be some overlap between names!) If someone has moved, they presumably know their former address and we can go through the process of updating that information as well. Most people don't want to go through this process, though; it's much, much quicker to use a self-checkout machine! The thing is, the machine can't read and interpret every ID in the world. Instead, a physical card with a barcode on it suffices to identify you to the machine. In theory, some of the machines could even read a photo of the barcode on your smartphone, but the library would still need to issue you that original exemplar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A large national library is going to have lots of readers from all over.

The change from AACR2 to RDA? Well, there's several answers to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The change in the National Authority File will be March 31, 2013. There will be some headings in the NAF that are still AACR2 and will need manual clean up, but the vast majority of headings will be &quot;RDA compliant&quot; and will require no maintenance. All new authority headings added to the NAF from April 1, 2013 on MUST be RDA headings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Library of Congress is going one step further, and switching ALL cataloging to RDA on the same timeline. They are currently in process of training all their catalogers so they will be ready for the March 2013 deadline. The training materials are available for free here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/catworkshop/RDA%20training%20materials/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.loc.gov/catworkshop/RDA%20training%20materials/index.html&lt;/a&gt; Information on LC's RDA plans is here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When asked at ALA, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; libraries intend on making the change from AACR2 to RDA cataloging in the same time frame, as in the first quarter (or half) of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Information from the PCC (Program for Cooperative Cataloging, aka BIBCO/CONSER/NACO/SACO) on implementation can be found on the PCC website: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/rda/RDA%20Implementation.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/rda/RDA%20Implementation.html&lt;/a&gt;  There is no &quot;hard and fast&quot; deadline for the switch. It's anticipated that once libraries start switching (and several libraries that participated in the test have continued to catalog in RDA so it's already started) it will have a snowball effect and more and more libraries will switch to RDA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How is this going to affect the millions of MARC records currently in AACR2 rules?&lt;/em&gt; Short answer: it's NOT. RDA was written so that AACR2 records will NOT have to be re-cataloged. AACR2 and RDA are perfectly capable of playing nice with each other and living side by side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, there are task groups working on the idea of &quot;hybrid&quot; AACR2/RDA records to fully utilize the benefits of RDA. The goal is to enhance the AACR2 records, without affecting their bibliographic integrity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of changing cataloging rules from AACR2 to RDA?&lt;/em&gt; Things like relationships in RDA are where the &quot;real&quot; benefits live. It's a step towards linked data. One of the biggest differences is just the way you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about a resource when you describe it.

We utilize thematic displays and individual easels spaced throughout the collection. Thematic displays are usually topical and will include as wide a variety of items as possible. A gardening display will have everything from container gardening to planning a landscape, and it might have DVDs, books, magazines, and flyers for an upcoming program. While it is always rewarding when someone takes an item from a display, it is especially rewarding when someone excitedly tells you they didn't know you had ... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a display is to get the viewer to slow down and engage, and perhaps find something new. It is essential that the items on display be attractive. Poorly circulating books generally make poor displays. We increased the circulation of our kids' nonfiction section by 22% this past year largely by putting books on easels throughout the area. Now kids can easily find the dinosaur books, the truck books, the animal books, Garfield, etc. Those displays empty out faster than any others in the library, but it isn't just the display books that are going. Once a kid has found where you hide the Lego books, they will often check out every one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am disinclined to do displays that are political or controversial. A favorite book display in some libraries is the annual banned book display, and I have to say it is one I do not favor. First of all, the books were rarely banned, they were only challenged and perhaps removed from a single library here or there. More than this, the underlying message is that we want to alert the public that someone somewhere wanted them not to be able to read these books. It says to people that banning or challenging books is bad. The truth is, whether or not we would ever consider the removal of a book from our library (since we follow a defensible collection policy), we welcome challenges - we may not enjoy them, and we don't want to deal with a new one every week, but we do want to know what the people in our community are worried about. Additionally, I think this display advertises to people that there may be materials in the collection of which they would disapprove. While we welcome challenges, we don't want to spend a lot of time on challenges for materials that people would not have ever picked up had we not waved the materials at them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="237" LastActivityDate="2012-07-16T04:39:46.553" />

We'll catalog them as books or serials - determining which method to use on a case-by-case basis. I do most of the zine cataloging myself. I catalog them in MARC using AACR2 (for the time being, anyway - RDA is right around the corner). So they're just as &quot;easy&quot; as other materials, in a sense. However, I do avail myself of certain non-required treatments, like adding summary notes to enhance keyword access and genre headings to aid in collocation of zines based on genre. I find these treatments important to circumvent some of the value-laden language of controlled vocabulary subject terms (for example, making sure that someone searching for queer zines can find them, despite the fact that that's not language that would occur in Library of Congress Subject Headings).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For other libraries, considerations such as time and the availability of copy cataloging may be a factor, so they might consider cataloging zines as a collection, rather than item by item.

David Rosenthal does a fantastic job breaking down the costs of digital storage in a number of posts on his blog (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dshr.org/2012/05/lets-just-keep-everything-forever-in.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://blog.dshr.org/2012/05/lets-just-keep-everything-forever-in.html&lt;/a&gt;) In short, although the price per gigabyte will continue falling, we will produce data at a faster rate. Therefore, digital repositories that commit to saving everything will have to commit increasing amounts of their budgets to purchasing storage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Ethics: As Trevor said in his questions, most donors have little idea that deleted files remain on their disks until they are over written. Even when they are overwritten, because of the way computer storage works, traces of deleted files can remain in the slack space. I would argue most donors are not agreeing to give files that they had deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Archivists work with shelf-space and budget constraints.

Should the embedded multimedia format become obsolescent, you'll have to can-open the PDF to yank it out and migrate it, afterwards trying to reconstitute the PDF. Complex objects are generally easier to preserve when different media types are kept in separate files (as with most HTML-based web pages).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Font-loss risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you don't embed fonts in your PDF, glyphs in those fonts may display wrongly or not at all on computers that don't have that font loaded. Over time, entire fonts can be lost or become unusable on modern equipment; I've heard from electronic thesis and dissertation managers that ETDs without fonts embedded have indeed suffered loss of information content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text non-computability risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scanning a print book page to PDF does not create computable text; it creates a picture of text. This is a common example of non-computable (non-indexable, non-searchable, non-text-minable, non-copy-and-pastable) digital &quot;text,&quot; though hardly the only one. Some word-processing and page-layout programs produce PDFs in which (for example) the page layout is incorrectly hinted such that trying to copy-and-paste across two columns of text produces sentence salad!

The core PDF format is based on a subset of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript&quot;&gt;PostScript&lt;/a&gt;, which is a programming language designed to produce graphics, and common graphics formats, but over time the format was expanded to allow streams to contain any type of data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PDF format is very complicated and pulls in several other complex specifications. In practice, the vast majority of PDF files were only validated by testing whether Adobe Acrobat can display them as intended and it is quite common to have PDF encoders generate output which breaks the standard in ways which Acrobat tolerates, leaving the problem to be detected only when the file is first used with other tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the subset of PostScript supported in PDF is not as capable as full PostScript (fortunately, as the latter which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness&quot;&gt;Turing Complete&lt;/a&gt;), it is still the case that what you actually have is executable program code and thus the only way to display PDF content is to execute each PostScript command in order:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/Times findfont 100 scalefont setfont&#xA;10 10 moveto&#xA;.5 .5 .5 setrgbcolor&#xA;(Hello World) true charpath fill&#xA;showpage&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This fragment uses only a subset of the language exposes the key areas of concern for simple PDF display:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this is program code, implementation details can affect the output. As a simple, hopefully purely hypothetical example, consider how processor or compiler-specific differences in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems&quot;&gt;floating-point rounding&lt;/a&gt; could affect a complex document after many operations cause display problems such as lines which are supposed to appear joined to have visible space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the full language is far more complicated than the subset above, there&#xA;are many variations on this theme. Fortunately the mainstream&#xA;implementations have generally converged on reliable inter-operability&#xA;but you are still likely to need a copy of Acrobat if you receive content&#xA;from a wide range of sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was particularly a problem in the past with older “print to PDF” drivers which simply took the raw PostScript which they would have sent directly to a printer and wrapped in a PDF container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Font choices are specified by name. The corresponding font file may be embedded within the PDF file but as system fonts are also supported, it's quite easy for authors to use special fonts and forget to embed them until the first time the PDF is opened on a system which does not have those fonts installed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've seen this somewhat frequently with academic journal articles which&#xA;were created using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX&quot;&gt;LaTex&lt;/a&gt; and use its fonts to display mathematical symbols. A Google search confirms that this is not an uncommon mistake as it will only be a problem when documents circulate outside the significant portion of scientific users who have the LaTeX fonts installed: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Cannot+find+or+create+the+font%22&quot;&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%22Cannot+find+or+create+the+font%22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType&quot;&gt;TrueType&lt;/a&gt; and particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType&quot;&gt;OpenType&lt;/a&gt; font formats are by necessity quite complex to deal with the range of human writing systems. Again, this is an area of potentially significant difference between implementations and, particularly for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_script&quot;&gt;complex scripts&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic&quot;&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari&quot;&gt;Devangari&lt;/a&gt;, the failures can potentially lead to the text being incorrect. Fonts are versioned, so it's possible to have text which would be displayed correctly if the operating system's version of a font is used instead of the embedded version or vice versa. The more obscure the languages you work with, the more you need to have some sort of system to check for correctness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For simple images, PDF writers are allowed to use &#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Raster_images&quot;&gt;a number of encodings&lt;/a&gt; and over the years various image formats have been added, all of which have require full software support:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Adobe.27s_versions&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Adobe.27s_versions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Adobe has also added many other types of rich content: audio, video, 3D imagery, etc. All of these include the full set of challenges for preserving their respective formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily for business users, Adobe has added several types of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF#Interactive_elements&quot;&gt;interactive forms&lt;/a&gt;, which rely on several complicated specifications and have in my experience been far less supported by third-party implementations, particularly the open-source community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PDF 1.2, support was added for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; as part of the forms specification. Since JavaScript is a full programming language, this means that the only way to process those actions is requires executing code in a manner consistent with the original implementation. Fortunately, this is likely to be uncommon in most preservation scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specification includes varying levels of encryption. It is possible to&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack&quot;&gt;brute-force&lt;/a&gt; weak passwords and the older encryption algorithms but that might be possible and the software to do so might be difficult or illegal to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In practice, many of the concerns are manageable with several precautions. If your content is not supposed to include the various rich media features the best place to start is by requiring the restricted subsets of PDF which have been developed to avoid many of these issues: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/A&quot;&gt;PDF/A&lt;/a&gt;, intended for preservation, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/X&quot;&gt;PDF/X&lt;/a&gt;, intended for reliable graphics exchange, which do not allow the more complex features and dramatically simplify the problem. If your goal is to archive general PDFs, however, you'll need to develop a more nuanced approach to audit the various complex features to check that a document does not include content which you are unprepared for (e.g. if your content includes embedded video, your auditing script could verify that the video stream uses a long-term viable &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec&quot;&gt;codec&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some features which you might want to audit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All fonts in the file are the standard core PDF fonts or embedded within the file.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All images are in the subset of formats which you are prepared to support and decode without errors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All content streams are checked against a whitelist of supported types&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The PDF is unencrypted or at least that the password is known and the file decrypts successfully&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="344" LastEditorUserId="344" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-07-27T23:34:41.273" LastActivityDate="2012-07-27T23:34:41.273" CommentCount="6" />

Assuring these things means that the record is authentic and will remain so. Note that this does not mean the digital record must always be maintained in the original format in which it was ingested into a digital archive, and it is particularly important to note that authenticity is not saying anything about the truthfulness, trustworthiness and veracity of the contents of the record, only that it is what is was said by its creators to be and was created by them in the context and at the time they say it was. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was some a lot of good archivally-based work done on authenticity and digital records by the InterPARES project at the University of British Columbia (http://www.interpares.org/) and the project published a lot of documents about the outcomes of the research.

This may in turn enable relatively insecure (read: &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;cloud&quot;) infrastructure to be used for the preservation of highly sensitive materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encryption doubles as an authenticity check, and in fact, some&#xA;encryption methods involve the creation of a digital signature that can&#xA;be used for provenance or bit rot detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encryption causes file size bloat to the tune of 20-30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For light archives, encryption imparts a performance penalty for systems that need to extract the content from the preservation archive for access purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another re-iteration: long-term secure preservation of the encryption keys themselves is typically raised as a legitimate concern. Fundamentally this problem is the result of two conflicting requirements: that the encryption keys be held by as few entities as possible to maintain their security, but also that they be easily acquired in disaster scenarios. I suggest that digital preservation repositories can mitigate (yet not fully eliminate) this concern by developing a management system for the encryption keys that leverages the technology frameworks (such as that for maintaining multiple copies with integrity checks) and policy frameworks (such as robust succession plans) that they ostensibly &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have in place by virtue of being qualified digital preservation repositories. One can imagine an architecture, for example, where encryption keys are safely stored within the repository itself and encrypted using a Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme that would require the consensual participation of any seven of thirteen parties named in the succession plan in order to obtain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not-cons: :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Personally, I don't buy the blanket argument that encryption increases the risk of bit rot because the argument assumes that the unencrypted form of the object is in fact resilient to single-bit error. I suggest that this risk be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and depending on the architecture of the repository, may represent no additional preservation risk. Moreover, I suspect that many if not most preservation repositories store content that is already sensitive to single-bit error by virtue of compression or the intrinsic nature of certain file formats.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with almost every other design aspect of digital preservation repositories, the use of encryption presents both utility and risk that should be carefully considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="683" LastActivityDate="2012-08-23T17:45:13.987" CommentCount="3" />

Look under &lt;em&gt;After other initial consonants&lt;/em&gt;: E&#xA;maps to 4.

Which is likely since many last&#xA;names begin with &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; and literary fiction is a fairly crowded part of the&#xA;shelflist.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call number is not complete however, there is a second cutter that the&#xA;instructions in the PS classification schedules (PS3550-3576) direct us to: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Subarrange individual authors by Table P-PZ40 unless otherwise specified&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  Including usually authors beginning to publish about 1950, flourishing&#xA;  after 1960&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Table P-PZ then in turn instructs the cutter to be created for separate&#xA;works, by the title of the work, filed between the cutters A61 and&#xA;Z458. Following our tables:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First letter of Reamde is &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Second letter is E. We look in the &lt;strong&gt;After other initial consonants&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;table: and see that E corresponds to 4. That makes our cutter so far&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;R4&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Third letter is A. We now look in the expansion table: See that A maps&#xA;to 3. That makes our cutter now: &lt;strong&gt;R43&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Usually we stop at the third letter (second number of the cutter). Most&#xA;authors are not prolific enough to justify needing to cutter out to a&#xA;third level. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note here that if you had a work like &lt;code&gt;245 10 $a Zodiac / $c Neal&#xA;Stephenson&lt;/code&gt; that it would go in the same classification &lt;strong&gt;PS3569.T3868&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;but would then get cuttered differently by its title &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;/em&gt;. However, we&#xA;can not follow the synthesis rules since they would create a cutter of&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Z63&lt;/em&gt; which does not fall in the permitted range for separate works that&#xA;the P-PZ40 table instructs us is between &lt;strong&gt;A61&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Z458&lt;/strong&gt;. In that case&#xA;we then would toss the tables out and then manually file the title starting&#xA;with &lt;strong&gt;Z&lt;/strong&gt; but giving ourselves a bit of space in the advent we get another&#xA;work with a title that files after &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Ambiguity&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately as you can probably see from the table not all letters are&#xA;explicitly listed out. And in addition with the expansion table, a range of&#xA;numbers are listed which leaves some issues with creating the appropriate&#xA;number.  In those case you then attempt to file in a way that will fit the&#xA;item in alphabetically with works already cuttered. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Note About Filing&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes libraries like filing.

If your higher-level software doesn't provide this, it's almost certain that you'll eventually experience a problem where something is corrupted and accessed before an audit catches it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filesystems can perform data-integrity checks (&quot;scrubbing&quot;) in the background, often when the storage subsystem is otherwise idle, reducing the performance impact and need for periodic manual scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filesystem based checksums can be far more efficient for random I/O because they're stored at the block level rather than the entire file. This is usually not a major consideration but in some scenarios where only part of the file is read it can be a significant performance benefit while providing full integrity checks (e.g. reading file metadata, preserving large databases, or JPEG-2000s which are used for thumbnails far more often full decoded).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Note that while ZFS is the most famous option in this regard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs&quot;&gt;btrfs&lt;/a&gt; and even NetApp's &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_Anywhere_File_Layout&quot;&gt;WAFL&lt;/a&gt; have some similar protections, albeit less thorough in the latter case)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not complete, however, as there are multiple other problems to be concerned with:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher level failures: e.g. if data is corrupted on the network, ZFS has no way of telling that the bits it methodically protected weren't actually the ones you wanted. Similarly, you can trust the bytes you read off of ZFS to be intact but you can't verify that they were received by a remote user unless you have some end to end checks (e.g. setting and validating HTTP Content-MD5 headers)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human error: no filesystem protects against a human accidentally or intentionally overwriting a file, although snapshots can help at least in the former case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replication: knowing that my bits are reliable still doesn't tell me whether you and I have the same file, or that I have a full and complete copy of a multi-file item. Something like a bag manifest is still necessary to address this and #1, and hopefully at least detect #2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, while filesystem-level features like ZFS's send/receive can also be very handy for efficient replication, compatibility is a big concern if you're worried about the longevity of a particular platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One other category of software to consider would be something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://swift.openstack.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStack's Swift&lt;/a&gt; which provides similar characteristics - full integrity checks, automatic redundancy management, user-invisible scalability - but does so using any available filesystem by providing the checks at a higher level.

The two databases are linked by the material number field (the bibliographic databases allowing multiple material numbers to be associated with one record). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having unique material numbers allows you to identify which copy a patron has out, which is particularly at issue when an item is lost or damaged. The call number is not sufficient for this. Call numbers are used to group like items together and to make items easy to find on the shelf.

This makes them suitable for use as part of scientific data workflows; the source code, data, and libraries used for a run can be snapshotted, and the output data captured as well. This facilitates replication.  Snapshots can be exported for remote archiving. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big advantage of ZFS over storing a file checksum in a bag or database is that corruption is detected and repaired. The block/checksum hierarchy makes it easier to detect whether it is the checksum itself that is corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to checksums and mirroring is to use a FEC type coding systems that can recover the correct signal  from corrupted symbols.  See e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6330&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RAPTORQ&lt;/a&gt; (though note &lt;a href=&quot;http://datatracker.ietf.org/ipr/1292/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the patent issues&lt;/a&gt; - claims are only waived for IETF standard or experimental broadcast/multicast object delivery protocol not using wide area wireless).  This might permit use in a massively distributed online archival storage mesh (e.g. using unused storage space on desktop computers, as an archival equivalent of fold-at-home). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BTW, although Oracle stopped releasing ZFS as open source, they could not take back the versions that were already released, and there is a vibrant open source community maintaining the code-  For example &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/maczfs/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MacZFS&lt;/a&gt; for MacOS.  FreeBSD includes ZFS by default. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zfsonlinux/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A native Linux port is being developed at Lawrence Livermore&lt;/a&gt;  - the project lead is Brian Behlendorf of Apache fame.

However, if your library stores the information, it could be required, by government authorities, to turn over the records it has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how much circulation information is stored varies library by library.  The integrated library system (ILS) we use  provides a couple of different options.  We store everything the borrower has currently checked out.  Once the borrower checks that item in, it comes off their checkout record.  However, their name stays associated with the item record until the next borrower checks the item out (this is in case we discover the item was damaged or is missing a DVD, etc).  In addition, we have the option to store additional checkout history if we wished.  The version of Horizon we use provides the options to only keep the basic circ history (detailed above), provide an opt-in for individual patrons to keep their circulation history, or turn on circulation history collection for all patrons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, we also have database backups.  So, while technically checkout information disappears from the patron records as soon as it gets checked in, in reality we do have a set number of days in backups that would contain additional checkout information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding who has access to this data:&#xA;This tends to vary state by state.  ALA, the American Library Association, has a page that offers links to various state laws: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/ifgroups/stateifcchairs/stateifcinaction/stateprivacy&quot;&gt;http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/ifgroups/stateifcchairs/stateifcinaction/stateprivacy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Colorado's statute is as followers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;Colorado Law 24-90-119. Privacy of user records. (1) Except as set forth in subsection (2) of this section, a publicly-supported library shall not disclose any record or other information that identifies a person as having requested or obtained specific materials or service or as otherwise having used the library. (2) Records may be disclosed in the following instances: (a) When necessary for the reasonable operation of the library; (b) Upon written consent of the user; (c) Pursuant to subpoena, upon court order, or where otherwise required by law; (d) To a custodial parent or legal guardian who has access to a minor's library card or its authorization number for the purpose of accessing by electronic means library records of the minor. (3) Any library official, employee, or volunteer who discloses information in violation of this section commits a class 2 petty offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars.&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that even parents don't have access to their child's record unless they have their child's library card or number. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My understanding, and I'm not a lawyer, is that Federal laws don't say who can't access the record but rather who can.  One of the big debates within library circles for the past decade deals with the USA PATRIOT act.

The primary argument for me is the combination of two facts: as with other data software is brittle, requiring regular maintenance, and libraries are not generally major power brokers in the commercial software field. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Software companies have a strong incentive to build applications for as wide a market as possible, leaving libraries with very limited buying power, and as with other areas of preservation, decisions are made based on current market realities and whims. We've seen this with systems like Apple's QuickTime which had very complex functionality (e.g. embedded Flash &amp;amp; other rich, programable content) added and later removed after falling into disfavor — certainly the right business decision and definitely a security benefit but completely stranding the small number of people with a significant investment in content which actually used those features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of the market, a small vendor may go out of business or have key personnel retire, leaving all of their users stranded with no option other than hoping an alternative is available and that the migration path is not too rocky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Open source software helps with several of these challenges:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the simplest case, it means that it's impossible for a vendor to simply disappear. It might not be cheap but at least you have the option of hiring a software developer to maintain or improve an open source application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Corollary: you really want to make sure that you actually save a copy of the source for anything you use if the current maintainer starts to seem shaky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's frequently a huge difference between a format as specified and as practiced. Using an entirely open-source stack now means that you have a known reference implementation from the beginning rather than finding out later that your data really only works well with one particular implementation. If you are forced to migrate later, it can be extremely helpful to have a known working codebase for reference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a related, open source software now almost always implies an open version control system which makes it much easier to determine where and how something stopped working. There's one other interesting aspect: the dominance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control_system&quot;&gt;distributed version control systems&lt;/a&gt; in the open source world is particularly powerful because it breaks the assumption of a single privileged maintainer, making it safer for your organization to maintain local customizations against upstream releases. Handling local customization gracefully traditionally has been a weak point for commercial software vendors for various reasons but it's integral to working in the open source world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a significant related advantage: open source software is usually considerably cheaper and you have cost saving options if you're not paying support but can perform some work in house – this is a benefit to the extent that it either frees budget for more direct preservation work and avoids unpleasant surprises down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these generally shift as a function of how close they are to your critical path: if you need a particular viewer for a file format, it's far more important than, say, a search engine on your storage system since the latter operates independently and can be swapped out far more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This strongly rewards keeping your architecture simple and standard because you lower the chances that you'll need to start supporting something which has fallen out of popularity within the community. For example, storing items in a database is far riskier than storing the same content on a filesystem simply because it introduces a massive chunk of complex, possibly expensive, software which has to work simply so you can retrieve a file and the lack of a standard interface would mean that you need to develop or pay for support in anything which needs to access the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="344" LastActivityDate="2012-09-25T19:17:37.833" />

So, queries that look like: &quot;discovery layer&quot; daterange:2452275-2452640 catalog (the date range is in Julian rather than Gregorian, but you can convert here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/JulianDate.php&quot;&gt;http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/JulianDate.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming you're talking about for libraries, but it doesn't look like that was the first usage.  I'm finding earlier links talking about &quot;discovery layers&quot; of Web services and, alternatively, device discovery.  For instance, there are references to it in talk about UDDI (Universal Discovery, Description and Integration), an XML-based discovery mechanism.  Symantec, on the hardware side, also talks about a Device Discovery Layer (DDL).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the earlier library-related references I found is on Lorcan Dempsey's blog (2005): &lt;a href=&quot;http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000865.html&quot;&gt;http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000865.html&lt;/a&gt;  He references earlier work done within OCLC using the discover(y) concept: &lt;a href=&quot;http://scanblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/discover-locate-request-deliver.html&quot;&gt;http://scanblog.blogspot.com/2005/02/discover-locate-request-deliver.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That just shows the idea was percolating.  So, figuring Dempsey's blog would be a good place to narrow the search, I searched for the full term &quot;discovery layer&quot;... the earliest reference is &lt;a href=&quot;http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000334.html&quot;&gt;http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000334.html&lt;/a&gt; where he uses it in quotes talking about the Arrow project (an Australian project developing institutional repository facilities for Australian Universities).  The quotes makes me think he is quoting their use of it.  This project was done in conjunction with VLTS (it seems).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is more detail on Arrow here &lt;a href=&quot;http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000792.html&quot;&gt;http://orweblog.oclc.org/archives/000792.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when I poke around the Arrow documents (http://www.arrow.edu.au/docs/), they talk more about a &quot;Discovery Service&quot; -- that's why I think the use of the term &quot;Discovery Layer&quot; in the earlier Web &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; literature is important/interesting.  I can't help but wonder whether it's something that OCLC (Dempsey and others) pulled from the Web services world (and adapted for libraries).  Later on, too, you see a lot of use by other Next Gen systems like Summons, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="68" LastActivityDate="2012-09-25T20:57:36.393" />

This is a very important point and should be considered carefully and repeatedly (external security audit?).&#xA;- the decryption keys should never be transported together with the related encrypted files&#xA;- storage of the decryption keys does not / should not have a higher level of security as  the storage of the encrypted files. The reason for this is that the organization is probably not familiar with higher levels of security, and higher levels of security introduce risks (too few people informed; unfamiliar technical solutions; no security audits because it is so little data)&#xA;- don't use generic decryption keys which apply to a lot of files&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether these suggestion really apply depends very much on the scenario you have in mind. At this moment I am thinking of a small number of selected files in our archive which are encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A completely different scenario would be an extra copy of all the files in our archive stored somewhere in the cloud, with all the files having the same decryption key. In this scenario it is not the problem of the management of decryption keys, but the management of this single one decryption key. Probably known only within a small circle of technical supporters. A loss of the key is no problem, as long as it is discovered soon. In that case the level of added data security because of the extra copy of all the files is lowered until a new copy is produced. The same goes for the account information and the passwords you need to access the extra copy. A seed based on the file name and path can help here.

For our purposes, however, we are&#xA;  interested in identifying file formats affected by both - obviously&#xA;  related - conditions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;those that can no longer be rendered (and are therefore obsolete); and&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;those that are likely to become unrenderable within a timeframe demanding action (and are therefore obsolescent).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For convenience, we refer to both conditions with the label file&#xA;  format obsolescence, which we believe is in line with common usage in&#xA;  the digital preservation community, even though it may invite some&#xA;  ambiguity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The paper also quotes me as describing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;“a scale of obsolescence that begins with inconvenience to users and&#xA;  ends in the digital black hole of loss”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it's important to remember that this is a very fuzzy concept and it means different things in different contexts. In most cases its more about inconvenience and cost rather than that extreme of absolute loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I used to work at the British Library, we informally used the term &quot;institutionally obsolete&quot; for digital content that either wouldn't run natively on a reading room machine or wouldn't run on a &quot;typical&quot; users machine without installing some additional software. A case that was &quot;institutionally obsolete&quot; might be quite easy to fix by a technically competent individual via some extra rendering software (and hence potentially dismissable as &quot;not really obsolete&quot;), but might be a significant issue for the management of reading room machine setup and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, obsolescence is a pretty meaningless concept without that crucial context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This of course then brings us to the concept of Representation Information (OAIS) and the idea of a network of information that informs the rendering and understanding of digital information. Progress in advancing this concept has been slow, but an approach to demonstrate how it could be realised was described and tested way back in the late 1990s by the Cedars Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://storageconference.org/2000/papers/D02PA.PDF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A blueprint for Representation Information in the OAIS model by Sergeant and Holdsworth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately we need more hard evidence on what obsolescence actually means in practical terms as a long term preservation risk. Andy Jackson made some first steps in analysing trends in format popularity within a web archive in this iPRES paper: &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1714&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Formats over Time: Exploring UK Web History&lt;/a&gt;.

A change that one group might consider to be just a new Manifestation might be considered by someone else to be a new Expression, or even a new Work.  (see the Library of Congress's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/whatfrbr.html&quot;&gt;What is FRBR?&lt;/a&gt; for a definition of Work, Expression and Manifestation).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main example of problem 'editions' are text books -- most editions of the book are effectively teaching the same concepts, in the same order, but there may be enough changes to pagination, layout or example problems that make it impossible for a student to do the same homework based on page &amp;amp; question numbers.  It's obviously a new Manifestation, but is it also a new Expression, or even a new Work?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For fiction, those problems don't tend to be as prevalent; there may be some content added (eg, a new foreward that puts the novel into a different context), but you don't tend to have as significant wholesale changes.  You may have some differences in editions intended for different audiences, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens#Alterations_between_versions&quot;&gt;additional footnotes and section in the American version of &lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More typically, if there's something of this magnitude in a novel, it'd be in artwork, but this gets into other issues if the art was not part of the original book.  (then you have a Manifestation with more than one Work: the original story plus the new artwork).  I can think of at least &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_%28novel%29#Publication_history&quot;&gt;one case where this was reversed, and the artwork removed in &lt;em&gt;Stardust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  In this case, we further complicate matters as the original publication was as a four part serial which was republished as a composite multiple times, then had the text portion stripped out which was also published in multiple forms.  (and then made into a movie, but movie adapations are generally considered to be new Works in FRBR; I also won't get into if it was a 'Composite Work' vs. a 'Composite Manifestation' for the initial collected work, but that issue of how to model composites I don't believe has really been solved).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then we get into issues of translations.  Now, most people wouldn't consider the Spanish translation of a book originally in English to be a new 'edition' of a book, and many people model translations as a new Work ... but what do we do when there are multiple translations into the same language?  Should they be considered editions of each other, or as seperate but related entities?  For instance, we have classic poems such as Dante's &lt;em&gt;Inferno&lt;/em&gt;, some translations that have attempted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0451531396&quot;&gt;more accurate translation&lt;/a&gt; while others attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0374525315&quot;&gt;maintain structure and rhyming&lt;/a&gt;.  In a possibly more extreme case, we have  the bible; there was a fair bit of disagreement over the 2011 NIV translation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where I've really seen the most problem isn't in books ... it's in movies.  All of the 'Deluxe Edition', 'Special Edition', 'Director's Cut', widescreen vs. pan &amp;amp; scan, etc.  And then you work in VHS vs. DVD vs. BluRay vs. HD-DVD vs. laserdisc, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So ... with all of this said, I'd really suggest you follow Jakob's &amp;amp; wdenton's advice, and look into existing systems.

The major differences that I've found are in the storage of metadata and the granularity of user permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Metadata Storage&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, one of the larger differences you'll see right now is the use of databases to record metadata. Alot of individual tools generate a METS/PREMIS object to contain the technical (format, file specifications, etc), administrative (copyright, etc) and descriptive metadata for each object or group of objects it processes. Digital preservation environments like Archivematica, Ex Libris Rosetta, and Tessella System Preservica/SDB also place this information into a database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using a database allows you to hook up your archive to a search system more easily and, I think most importantly, it gives you better control over future preservation actions. For instance, you can run a report to return a list of all the formats you're holding. Then, when you identify a format you'd like to migrate, you can search for a list of those specific files. The metadata and database should then track whatever preservation actions you perform on those objects. Note that it's probably safer to maintain both the metadata object and the database to guard against either becoming disassociated from the preserved objects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;User Permissions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, commercial systems often include more complex systems for defining user access. Rosetta and SDB/Preservica both allow administrators to restrict actions like ingest, preservation, and metadata editing to certain classes of users, and will record the ID of users that perform these actions. Restricting access increases the security of files and builds greater provenance. However, this feature is not as necessary for smaller organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit 2013/03/04: Thanks to Artefactual Systems for clearing up an error on my part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="518" LastEditorUserId="518" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2013-03-04T19:40:36.603" LastActivityDate="2013-03-04T19:40:36.603" />

Knowing their strategy at such a point would enable them to provide guidance to creators that would:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enable the creators to create without unnecessary limitations on which software or formats they should use (formats can restrict functionality)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Enable efficient and effective continued long term access to the objects&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not be cost-prohibitive over the projected life of the objects to either the creator or future steward of the digital objects&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality both Libraries and Archives rarely have a sufficient degree of influence over the creation of the content that they end up handling to be able to enforce the application of any guidance they might want to give. As a result it is worthwhile to consider other points at which Libraries and Archives might benefit most from deciding upon their interaction/access strategy for their digital objects.&#xA;If emulation were to be enacted as a long term access/interaction (I’ve substituted interaction for viewing here as I suspect that is what Trevor is more interested in) strategy then the next best time for the Library or Archive to decide to do this is likely to be before they accept items for transfer to the Library or Archive. Making the decision at that point enables a number of key steps to be included in the transfer process that will make enacting the emulation strategy much easier:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Intended rendering applications/environments can be identified via the transferring agency or donor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Software licenses and binaries can be transferred to the Library or Archive.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Standard rendering/interaction environments (e.g. “all of government desktops”) can be snapshotted and moved to emulated hardware for use in interaction/access the objects that are to be transferred.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of these steps are much more difficult and costly, or impossible at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How late can a Library or Archive leave deciding what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The  answer to this question will depend on what the impact will be of a Library or Archive leaving their decision until very late. &#xA;What might the &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&#xA;If they were to use emulation as their strategy at that point then:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;they might struggle to know which software to emulate to use for interacting with the objects (i.e. they may not be able to ascertain what the intended interaction environment should be). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be no emulator available for the particular environment they want to emulate and:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) No documentation left to enable them to create a new emulator for that environment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;b) A significant cost may need to be incurred to create a new emulator for that environment&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;c)No documentation left to enable use of emulated environment and effective interaction with the object by non-specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What might the &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; consequences be for a Library or Archive if they were to leave making their decision about what their digital object interaction or access strategy should be till the point at which someone needs to view or access their objects?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tools to identify original creation environment and associated default interaction environment may have been created and developed to a point of high functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2011-05-19-remote-emulation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Emulation services&lt;/a&gt; may be available at a low cost that are simple to use and inexpensive (e.g. submit the object and it is remotely emulated and provided for interaction via a browser or local app).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;End-user software documentation may be available and integrated with emulation tools and services as a “help-layer” enabling easy use of old software by users who have moved on to new interaction paradigms. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The consequences of leaving such a decision to such a late point when using other strategies will be different. When deciding which strategy your Library or Archive will use it will be worth considering the consequences of the decision with respect to all possible choices. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under what conditions should a library or archive choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy rather than an alternative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to answer this question. Firstly, a Library or Archive should always choose an emulation based solution as its digital object interaction or access strategy when there are no feasible alternatives. When might that be the case?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what point does emulation become the only option as a digital preservation strategy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is potential for an emulation solution to become the only option for a Library or Archive to use as their interaction/access strategy for their digital content. Such a situation might arise if the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;necessary interaction software still exists&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;an emulator to run the software exists or can be constructed and tested using original compatibility tests (for more information on how to know when to trust an emulation solution see &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33771879522/how-could-son-b-could-rely-on-the-emulation-solution&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;using original hardware and software is not an option&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;no alternative interaction or viewing tools are available (such as migration/normalization tools). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many files have been created with structures that are not openly documented and for which the only tool available for interacting with or viewing the content captured in that structure is the original software.  In such cases, assuming the documentation outlining the way the software writes the files cannot be acquired, using the original hardware is not an option, and the original interaction software can be loaded into an emulated environment, then emulation will likely be the only option left  available. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may be possible to use reprogrammable hardware such as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Field Programmable Gate Array&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=21936534#comment-21936534&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;create the original hardware in programmable hardware&lt;/a&gt;. But for all intents and purposes this is effectively another (potentially faster) version of emulation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should a Library or Archive choose emulation as their interaction/access strategy only for particular kinds of content and another strategy for other kinds of content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Digital object interaction/access strategies that rely solely on emulation will never be appropriate for interacting with or accessing object content that involves a hardware component. In such cases, for example when replicating the full experience of a video game as played on a particular console, emulation alone will not be enough for accessing/interacting with the content. Replica hardware, such as game controllers, may need to be produced in order to maintain the full content experience. The advent of inexpensive microcomputers such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raspberrypi.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;raspberry pi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21565577-new-manufacturing-technique-could-help-poor-countries-well-rich-ones?fsrc=scn/tw/te/pe/athirdworlddimension&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;inexpensive 3D printers&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makerbot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MakerBot&lt;/a&gt; may make this option much more viable and prevalent in the near future. &#xA;A migration strategy that is able to be tested and confirmed for every object it is used to access may be more practical in some circumstances for use as a viewing/interaction strategy. For example if processing a lot of simple objects that have few components to them migration may be more economical. Unfortunately most migration tools and processes currently do not incorporate comprehensive testing procedures and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archives.govt.nz/resources/information-management-research/rendering-matters-report-results-research-digital-object-r&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;anecdotal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info/v1/migration-issues/wordstar-migration-to-ms-word/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests that migration processes can often destroy content. In such cases the processes are effectively failing at adequately enabling viewing or interaction with the object as the object no longer exists in the same form post migration. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most good migration candidates are simple objects that often can still be accessed by current software such as text-based formats and simple images. As they can often still be accessed by current software there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dshr.org/2007/04/format-obsolescence-scenarios.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;question to be asked&lt;/a&gt; as to why the Library or Archive would bother migrating them at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Under what circumstances would emulation be a preferable option to the alternatives for accessing or interacting with content?.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In almost all cases employing an emulation strategy for interacting with or viewing old digital content will be preferable than any alternatives. Emulation gives a richer, more &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authenticity_in_art&amp;amp;oldid=516960597#Authenticity_of_performance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;authentic&lt;/a&gt; experience that can often evoke more emotion and feeling in the viewer than just seeing some raw data would. When coupled with options to enable the user to print the emulated content they are viewing, to copy text &amp;amp; images from the object into a modern environment, to print the content to a file, or to use the original rendering software to create a new file based on the old file but using a different save-as parameter (e.g. from a .doc file to a .rtf), the emulation experience is often a much fuller and more gratifying experience than alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When in a court of law in which digital evidence is being presented I would personally want to see the content that was presented using the original software, rather than seeing whatever content was left when the original file(s) was run through a migration process (i.e. see the actual content rather than manipulated/different content). I have blogged about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalcontinuity.org/post/33715122952/a-scenario-illustrating-the-importance-of-digital&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In fact this would be my preference in most if not all circumstances in which something important in my life hinged on some old digital content. Whether or not this is a widely held opinion still needs to be tested, however the Rules of the High Court of New Zealand were recently updated to include references to the need for preservation of “native electronic documents” when such objects are submitted as evidence. Native electronic documents or native file formats are defined as: “an electronic document stored in the original form in which it was created by a computer software program”. This may indicate a greater recognition of the need to enable access to/interaction with unaltered versions of digital objects. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emulation may turn out to be cheaper and economically “fairer” than alternative options.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emulation may have two economic advantages over alternative methods:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once emulation services are in place the processes that Libraries or Archives need to implement if choosing an emulation strategy will likely be less onerous than alternatives. The essential steps for implementing an emulation strategy in such an organisation are to know what environments they need for interacting with all their digital objects and to make sure a service exists that provides that environment. The organisations can then choose which business model to operate under to enable access to/interaction with the objects. They might, for example, have a few workstations in their buildings for users to use at no cost for interacting with the objects. And/or they may have a limited set of remote-access licenses. In such cases the end-users would have an option for no-cost access to the objects but if they want to they could also pay for a remote service themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these optional business models and the low initial cost for Libraries and Archives, emulation tools services are likely to cost less to maintain over time. A single emulator can be used to maintain thousands of emulation environments (or more). The long term maintenance costs will relate to migrating the emulator to new host environments over time. To reduce this cost, initiatives such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://dioscuri.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dioscuri&lt;/a&gt;  the modular emulator offer mechanisms for lowering this cost by removing the need to migrate much of the code base. Most importantly though, the cost of migrating the one emulator to enable the continued emulation of thousands of environments, which in turn enables continued access to millions/billions of digital objects, is likely to be much less than the cost to continually migrate each individual digital file over time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore with emulation you are always able to open objects structured with a particular format. With migration/normalisation you may have to decide how long you want to maintain a migration path for. So, for example, if in 100 years time someone comes to you with a WordStar 6 file that they found on a server of legacy objects, there may no longer be a migration path available for it. On the other hand, if emulation had been the chosen strategy for those files then they will still be accessible using the emulated environment used for the other WordStar 6 files that still exist in your Library or Archive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the second reason why emulation may be a preferable option for your Library or Archive: it may be economically fairer. Emulation, unlike continued migration or normalisation, enables Libraries and Archives to pass the access/interaction costs on to the generation that is using the objects. Emulation is applied just in time rather than just  in case and so enables the cost to be born by the user (or the institution) at the time of use rather than by whoever is there whenever the files need to be migrated, or by the agency when the file is transferred and normalised. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a good point at which to address Normalisation. Functionally normalisation is the same as migration but conducted when the objects are first in the possession of the Library or Archive. Eventually all normalised files will also have to be migrated just as migrated files will eventually have to be re-migrated when the new files are no longer accessible. Any decent migration strategy should be migrating content to open formats and therefore should eventually get the same results as a (open standards based)  normalisation strategy would and therefore the two strategies can be equated and over the long term fall-prey to the same criticisms mentioned elsewhere in this answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to readdress the questions Trevor asked:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what point, or under what conditions should a library or archive plan on emulation as a strategy for viewing and or making accessible particular kinds of content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Library or Archive should decide on their strategy as early as possible to gain the most economic benefit as possible. They should choose emulation in most circumstances as it provides a better outcome, but most definitely when they have no other choice. They will not be able to choose emulation alone as a strategy for all content, e.g. content that has a physical component, however if they do choose emulation then it is likely that they will be economically better off and the costs of implementing their strategy will be more fairly distributed to the users that actually benefit from it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general though the most important things a Library or Archive can do right now to keep their options open in regards to access/interaction strategies are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Document what you have. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fully understand the creating applications and intended interaction applications. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acquire software &amp;amp; licenses for the software you may need to emulate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take snapshots of interaction environments (and potentially interesting desktops or servers). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have the creators tell you what the formats objects are structured using&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have creators tell you which environments should be used with their objects&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have creators tell you what content should be preserved from digital files (including physical components and interactive components -e.g. is being able to turn on and off tracked changes important?) and which content can be removed during a preservation or access/interaction process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly document the date the object was created - this can provide one of the best indicators for which tools might be needed for access/interaction. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Provide support for the development of tools and services&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emulation tools and services have the potential to provide an amazingly rich digital history experience. It is my hope that one day emulation will be the default and invisible option used for accessing older digital content.  Objects will automatically be opened in their intended interaction environment and users will be able to extract data and gain insight from the original content in the intended context. Hopefully my answer here helps convince others to get behind this vision also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="766" LastEditorUserId="766" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2012-11-05T01:20:45.067" LastActivityDate="2012-11-05T01:20:45.067" />

The KryoFlux software handles decoding the flux transition data into sector data, but to do so, it requires you to know something about the media you're trying to acquire. Nonetheless, it's a reliable piece of hardware in terms of acquiring a baseline regardless of the underlying encoding or logical format on the media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the license for the KryoFlux for anything other than personal use is somewhat restrictive and expensive.

The Makerspace is an extension of this as well as the fairly traditional role of the library as a community space. In a Makerspace, knowledge and skills are shared democratically across age groups.

They are organized by shoot, and we may have some basic date and event information, but image-level metadata is limited to what was automatically created by the camera.

If the images represent a more-or-less casual record, then the JPEGs may be sufficient (they contain sufficient information for most display and printing purposes). But the NEFF files will definitely contain the most information; they will allow more flexible further post-processing (for example, images may be 12 or 14 bits per channel rather than 8 bits for JPEG; there will be information on white balance settings etc, that can be adjusted).

If you're trying to show his creative process, then they might have value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The discussions of bits per channel is misleading -- if we were to talk about books, think of the NEF file as a high resolution scan of an early draft of a written work, and the JPEG has a lower resolution scan of the published work.  Yes, one's of higher resolution, but does it actually capture something that's worth keeping?

In other words, we keep both versions of every image we're keeping, but we are selective about which images we keep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are there corresponding DNG files for every JPEG?  If so, that might be something to eliminate.  (eg, the equivalent of a photographer not making prints from every negative).  And as you mention, similarity to other photos may be the reason, if the photographer selected what they considered 'best' ... but depending on the purpose of the archive, someone doing future research may be interested in what the photographer considered to be sub-par.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(depending on the type of work they did, it's possible that they weren't making the selections, eg, if it were wedding photos or something else where a client might decide which ones they wanted, and then the additional processing was done)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And remember, you have options besides not accepting the image -- it may be that you reduce the individual files -- either lossy compression or rescaling so that you preserve every image, but possibly not at the full fidelity that you received them.  You may want to identify how much storage you can devote to this, and then come up with various scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;keep 50% of the images at original size, discard the rest&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;keep 40% of the images at original size, the rest reduced to 1/6 their size&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;keep 30% of the images at original size, the rest reduced to ~1/4 their size&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;keep 40% of the images in the main repository, the rest on a lower class of storage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this could get really complex ... the first analysis pass may not identify enough candidates for weeding, and so you may have to expend more resources for additional analysis, making it cheaper to adjust the strategy or allocate more storage..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For those of you who work in this scale routinely, what computational or other challenges will this volume pose that we probably haven't encountered before?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have to reprocess the data, there might be some computational issues, but it might be possible to use cloud computing for this.  The main issue that I run into is access -- we don't want to serve the full resolution file if there is some smaller variant that will suffice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eg, if you have 20 megapixel images, most people won't need that resolution if they're just browsing through the images.  You might be able to serve images at 1/2 or 1/4 scale (1/4 or 1/16 the pixel count) for most people.  Those that want to zoom in to see detail could then request the higher fidelity image if the browse image won't suffice for their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you could use something like JPEG2000 and a JPIP server so that you don't have to maintain multiple processed forms of the images, but support isn't currently baked into most web browsers, so you have to have some sort of intermediary service do the conversion between JPEG2000 and JPEG.  I don't know what the current status is for this sort of thing in conventional archives, as we have some abnormal use cases and interface with a bunch of ad-hoc services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess the only real consideration that I can think of is how you're going to be getting the files.  Depending on the schedule that you'll be ingesting, over the network may not be efficient.  For large, bulk transfers (eg, the 15TB initial load), we physically transport the disks.  (USB or firewire drives + FedEx or UPS if it's long distance)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I find that 15TB isn't really the important number, the important issues are the maximum image size (can we open them to look at them, or are they too large for most of our current desktops?) and the number of discrete files (it takes just as long to catalog a 50kB image as a 50MB one, once you get past the process of opening the file)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="62" LastActivityDate="2013-01-14T22:49:46.400" />

A nice way to consider the position is to flip this straight to an analogue paradigm. Its not identical, but it works close enough. Assuming there is a 1:1 relationship between the NEF and JPG files, the NEF are the print negatives and the JPG are the print positive. &#xA;Now how does that fit with your existing collection strategy? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;it looks safe to estimate that the NEF files make up about 2/3 of the storage space.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Find out. This is one of your most urgent tasks - to know what to do, you must first understand what you have. Find out the relationship between NEF:TIF instances of the same intellectual object. Find out the number of each. Find out the average sizes of each type (plus standard deviation so you can see how close the set is to the average) - use a file listing application for this. Find out the resolutions for the two sets - (NEF should be relatively easy - close cohesion to the average file size? very likely all the same resolution, jpg? use exiftool and pull out just the h x w resolution, h/w resolution dpi, and possibly bit depth from the exif - throw that into a db  / spread sheet, and look through the range of sizes you. You might be able to throw away Lo Res jpgs from the off).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What would be the potential loss to the archives and to the historical record if we only preserved the JPGs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A very broad question, with lots of missing parts of the story for us to judge on. Assuming the JPGs are all acceptably high quality versions of the NEF files, arguably not a great deal.... unless you are interested in documenting the photographic process - example - what is the relationship between the NEF &amp;amp; JPEG? cropping? tonal shifts? touch up? de-skew/rotation? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a technical angle, the NEF will offer significantly higher informational density for the image, but you should consider what that informational density represents. The Jpeg compression works by 'throwing away' higher frequency information. What does the jpeg compression thats been applied do to the resulting image? a good implementation of a jpeg compressor, set to a light compression ratio can be visually imperceptible in an image. A poor one is very noticeable. &#xA;At this point, its a trade off. If you wanted, you could profile the difference between the two &quot;identical&quot; images in a couple of ways - computationally you can find the RMSe noise ratio between two images, do some experiments so you understand what the RMSe value is telling you, or your could open them both, and 'subtract' one from the other, looking at the 'difference' channel. This will show you where there is a difference between the tow images. Do this a few times, and start to understand the representational difference between the two types.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a storage angle... What access do you have to storage? is your solution going to gracefully scale to fulfill this requirement? Whats the slightly longer term perspective (being cognisant of Moore's and Kryder's Laws...). Are these files being kept somewhere safe while you explore/research and decision make? What risks are associated with their current storage carrier? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From an access angle... who is going to be the primary user of this collection. Will they be happy being offered large NEF files that they need to interpret somehow to see the images? Will you / do you currently offer access copies - could these be the JPGs and save you a processing step elsewhere in your lifecycle?   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If we take the NEF files, do we convert them immediately to DNG, TIFF or another format?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, I would be exploring this very quickly, probably 2nd priority. What version of NEF are they? what tools currently exist to interact with them. Is there a current viable format I could move them too? or am I just kicking the can a little way down the road... &#xA;TIFF does not offer the same capability as the NEF file, so I would argue its not a lossless transformation, and thus it doesn't really belong in this discussion, its a 'middle' format between NEF and jpg. Higher visual fidelity is achievable, but not all the features of the NEF can be captured. Repeat the tests between the JPG and NEF to get a feel for any informational loss. (if a lossy compression is used).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself, is DNG stable enough? supported enough with render tools and other methods of interacting with DNG file types? Do you have the ability and capability to convert the numbers of files you are facing? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What about some kind of heuristically-guided, content-based weeding? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What methods exist to identify content suitably? You could for example use a face detector (such as the one found in picassa v3 onwards) to locate images with faces that are large enough for it to trigger a match. other than that, I'm not sure there are many options open to you on the image content side. Can you do anything with creation/last modified dates? are there any file structures that you can use to filter? Could you get a quick tagger written that would allow you to quickly flag a low res version as a &quot;keeper&quot; (or perhaps use tagging functions in other tools like Adobe Lightroom or Picassa.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In other words, we keep both versions of every image we're keeping, but we are selective about which images we keep.

Your storage requirements change at this point, as you can keep the large res versions where they are, and only throw the low res versions only costly spinning (shared?) storage when you need to assess the content.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The department is very eager for us to take these and is willing to follow our guidance on how to proceed, and also has student labor to throw at a project if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you have the person power, and the direction from your business unit... it looks like its all about the technical challenges....  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;15 TB would be the largest set of materials we've accessioned, by a very long shot.

It could actually bear an impact on answers here if you could provide that information. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I would advocate a solution where you DO migrate but maintain the originals. One way is to keep two digital objects. This has its own technical implications beyond the scope of this answer. Another mechanism which a colleague of mine adopted for digital objects was to maintain a binary diff of the old and new objects using bsdiff. Adopting this approach one could apply bspatch to the new file to re-create the old one bit for bit without having to keep the original around - thus saving on storage. Again this approach has its own technical implications and you should study the output to understand the size of bspatch files created from bsdiff. This will also be more beneficial for files where binary changes are small and files that you are unlikely to migrate again for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further you need to think about controlling your migration and what output format you are selecting.

In my opinion, this migration activity is unnecessary and possibly damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The JHOVE tools assess a particular file's adherence to its respective format specification. They do not specifically report on long term preservation risks that the PDF might contain. The two might overlap, but in many cases they are different, so further (and considered) interpretation of what these tools report is essential. The answers to &lt;a href=&quot;http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/964/what-preservation-risks-are-associated-with-the-pdf-file-format&quot;&gt;this stack question&lt;/a&gt; should be useful in making this interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what defines a file format? In theory the file format specification and perhaps also (as Andy mentions) a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;reference implementation&lt;/a&gt; (eg. JasPer for JPEG2000 or Acrobat for PDF). However, particular files themselves are defined by one thing, and one thing only: the creating application. How closely the creating application adheres to a file format specification varies from application to application. Many don't adhere particularly closely and as a result, rendering applications tend to be very tolerant of common breaches of the relevant specifications (whether these breaches are due to poor implementation of the creating application, or alternative interpretations of ambiguous format specifications). And of course file format specifications and reference implementations don't always match up. In summary, a file format is to an extent a fuzzy concept, rather than the precise description implied by a &quot;file format specification&quot; document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So given this somewhat confusing picture, what do we need to worry about when we acquire a PDF that we want to preserve for the long term?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a growing consensus in the community (I only have anecdotal evidence for this) that if a file is judged invalid in relation to it's file format specification, but renders completely without problem in most common renderers, then there is no significant long term risk. This is of course arguable. The counter argument would suggest that rebuilding a renderer from the specification at a future time when the format had become obsolete would not lead ultimately to successful rendering of the invalid file. In my opinion, this scenario seems rather unlikely when we have open source code (eg. xpdf) that does tolerate invalid files, and should provide some insurance against &quot;catastrophic obsolescence&quot; scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If action &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; to be taken in migrating an invalid PDF to a valid PDF, there are some key issues to think about. Any format migration is potentially very dangerous and could result in damage to the content. It's therefore important to keep the original, or consider keeping a diff of the transform (as Ross suggested), and perform some kind of quality check on the new file. Given the difficulty in performing this check in an automated manner, the case for &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; migrating to address invalid-ness becomes stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="158" LastActivityDate="2013-01-30T14:19:19.770" CommentCount="2" />

Initially we noted every instance that we encountered. This resulted in some nice data that showed this issue (of JHOVE failing pdf) is found across all pdf types that get ingested, and at a anecdotal rate of about 1 in every ~250 being flagged by JHOVE as having an issue of some sort. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We currently programatically ignore the flag from JHOVE if we can render the file. If we can render the file, we assume complete fail, and look into the file specifically. When we ignore the flag, a record is keep that a file was given an error by JHOVE, but the file is allowed to proceed unhindered into the perm storage. By ignoring the flag, we are essentially making a statement of intent that says &quot;We acknowledge there is a potential risk with this file - we are currently unable to isolate the specific reason for the error, nor diagnose any specific long term risk for the content of the file.

Anecdotally, the traditional view of IT services and preservation seems to be more along the lines of month-to-month preservation focusing mainly on bitwise preservation (hashing, replaying of bitstreams, delivery of suitable applications).  I think it takes quite a conceptual shift to understand that year-to-year preservation has a much longer purview, and in principle is less focused the bitwise preservation, and more the conceptual preservation of information. This means assuring informational blocks through time, and not just binary blocks (IT based colleagues, feel free to shoot this one down!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database Admin / Analyst (DBA)&lt;/strong&gt; - For me this a bread and butter role of a repository. You need to understand what your objects are, how to locate them, how to access them, how to check on them, and we're talking about large numbers of digital objects. Whilst its not a core DP role perhaps, its takes a DBA a decent amount of knowledge to understand the specific preservation based questions and functions that are needed in a DP system - a good example is the notion of managing a moving hash value (object A comes in with hash A, preservation function occurs and object is changed, resulting a new object (B) and thus in hash A and hash B relating to the same intellectual object. Anything that happens to object A must be reflected in someway with object B, and so these things are abstractly but intrinsically linked - its a small example, but an example none the less of how a traditional DBA needs some additional models to work from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Content Specialist&lt;/strong&gt; - Someone who can tell you what is important from a technical perspective about any digital object you encounter. Needs a very diverse set of skills (arguably the most important one is good google-fu...) some comprehension of what information contained inside a digital object (primary and meta), what standards are for file / information types and how to tell if something does meet a standard, what to do with invalid digital objects, managing / recording / explaining what the holding institution knows about the digital object (e.g. does this TIF image contain GIS information in the XMP sidecar, if so, what does it point to?), a list of other technical functions that could be asked at any time to help the holding institution collect, appraise, record and store digital things (including assessing and dealing with unknown bitstreams....) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservation Action Specialist&lt;/strong&gt; - Someone who is responsible for the preservation functions. Migrations, access copy generations, any emulation platform, interpretations of objects, creation of groups of objects that can be worked on together, knowing how to tell that story to content owners / guardians so they can be comfortable with any actions being undertaken, informing policy, reporting on processes, keeping informed etc etc... &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservation Policy Specialist&lt;/strong&gt; - Someone to handles the internal policy side of ensuring that preservation activities are properly codified, documented and aligned with other business units and they handle the theoretical  / philosophical concerns and considerations of preservation management.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put the policy role at the least technical side of the technical roles. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the contextual side, I'd have to say its the usual library, museums and archive functions (records management, collection planning, collecting, curating, indexing, cataloging etc) but in a way that is (1) digitally savvy and (2) preservation aware. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="888" LastEditorUserId="888" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2013-02-13T01:07:20.987" LastActivityDate="2013-02-13T01:07:20.987" CommunityOwnedDate="2013-02-13T03:42:32.140" />

Most average hobby-grade 3D printers are priced the $1000-3000 US range. You start seeing higher quality in 3D printers after the $20,000 price point, but this is far too expensive for the majority of public libraries to afford.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;For plastic filament costs (or what the 3D printer prints builds objects with), in my experience, having a hobby grade 3D printer printing non-stop 24 hours a day will use about $60 worth of plastic over one month. The plastic commonly used with hobby-grade 3D printers is either ABS (Lego) or PLA (bio-degradable corn based) plastic. With higher-end 3D printers these costs easily triple. The costs of plastic filament increase with non-hobbyist 3D printers such as 3D Systems Cubify 3D printer, which force their owners to buy plastic filament from a fixed supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Once they’re up and running hobby grade 3D printers do not involve that much staff time. Throughout a day a public library could expect to have a single staff member spend about an hour of time working with their 3D printer. The problem with hobby grade 3D printers, though, is that they break down, and when this happens unexpectedly (and it will happen soon or later) this can quickly become a drain on staff resources. The time it takes to set up and learn how to use a 3D printer can be a time consuming process as well, typically requiring around 2 weeks of intensive work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Many other building tools are featured in Maker Spaces besides 3D printers, such as laser cutters and computer numeric controlled (CNC) machines, which work much like 3D printers in that they can turn a digital 3D model into a physical object.

Then, if they're being used frequently, the plastic (ABS or PLA) will cost an additional $100-$200 US a month. A good source for hobby grade 3D printer information is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.makezine.com/volume/make-ultimate-guide-to-3d-printing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Make Magazine's: Ultimate Guide to 3D Printing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Higher end 3D printers start at $10,000 US (such as Stratasys' Mojo printer) and run up to the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The material costs are much more expensive too, and the 3D prints often require additional cleaning, most commonly by blasting them with compressed water. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The higher end 3D printers produce much better prints than the hobby grades, but they are much more expensive to maintain. 3D prints rarely fail on these machines though, a problem that will quickly turn into extreme frustration when working with hobby grade 3D printers. The 3D prints themselves are much more expensive too, in a large part due to closed 3D printing material sources (the big 3D printing companies such as 3D Systems and Stratasys have traditionally run a &quot;Razor &amp;amp; Blade&quot; business model for their 3D printing consumables). As such the higher end 3D printers would be more suited to a library that knows the 3D printers will be used by professionals such as architects or engineers. Otherwise, if they are just opening up 3D printing to a patron base not familiar with them, the costs of 3D printing with a hobby grade printer will be much more attractive, which has been my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are definitely staffing issues involved with having a 3D printer. Hobby grade 3D printers especially require a lot of staff time. There are always misprints, prints will fall of the build platform, plastic will get clogged, etc., and it can be very time consuming to fix and maintain these 3D printers, which again has been my experience with them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Professional grade 3D printers run without much of a need for staff involvement, outside the cleaning process. I have worked with these quite a bit too, and I can say this from experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Professional grade 3D printers are also more enclosed and easier to open to the public. Hobby grade 3D printers are much more difficult to make publicly available. It is very easy to damage these machines, and very difficult to repair them. If a hobby grade 3D printer is made available it should definitely be in an area where staff can monitor it and ensure that patrons are not putting their hands inside of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By providing a 3D printer to library patrons, an important issue to address is 3D modelling skills. There's a number of models freely available on Thingiverse.com but to really have a makerspace, 3D design skills need to be promoted in some way. There are a few good, free programs available such as TinkerCAD and Google Sketchup, but this is a very difficult issue to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend trying to partner with professional organizations in this. I have done a lot of work with CBCL Ltd. Consulting Engineers, who have been extremely helpful in providing additional funding. Then in return we are able to provide them with low cost 3D printing, and a better exchange of ideas between engineering students. There is a lot of interest in 3D printing technology and, in my experience, it has not been very difficult finding professional organizations willing to invest money into library makerspaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have considered providing other makerspace tools outside of 3D printers, such as CNC machines and laser cutters, but it is difficult bringing these into a library setting due to noise and safety issues, and because of this they would need constant staff supervision. Right now we do have a laser scanner available that can work in relation to the 3D printer. The tools you can provide really depends on your space and how your patrons would want to use it. Arduino chips and other electronic components are also popular makerspace staples. Tools such as these definitely require a very tech savvy patron base though, that not all libraries are going to have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before deciding on what tools to provide patrons in a makerspace, I would recommend consulting with patrons directly, as well as talking to any local business that may also take advantage of this space, such as machinists or architects, who might also be able to provide additional instructional sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="964" LastEditorUserId="964" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2013-02-19T11:41:10.723" LastActivityDate="2013-02-19T11:41:10.723" />

I don't think it's in the spirit of makerspaces to focus too much on specific tools.  Many people are caught up in the 3D printing hype and 3D printing is totally amazing, but consider whether it might be more useful to have other (potentially cheaper) tools.  For example what about high-end sewing machines?  Power tools?  Electronics workbench ( soldering/de-soldering equipment, oscilloscope )?  DIYBookScanner?  A laser cutter may actually be more useful to more people ( and easier to teach ) than a 3D printer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Buying a 3D printer and putting it in a room is not having a makerspace, imo.  The tool choice should be driven be the demand of the community.  If there is no community, start by forming one, then find out what tools the community wants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forming a community of makers first and then creating a space will also help you decide whether to have the space open to the public.  You definitely don't want to have dangerous equipment out without at least a docent, preferably a maker, on hand to talk to people and teach them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd highly, highly, highly, recommend reaching out to your local hackerspace ( hackerspaces.org ) and find folks with some experience.  You might be surprised to find people there willing to volunteer to help you build your makerspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, I think libraries interested in pursuing makerspaces need to start by defining the community of makers they want to serve and reaching out to that community.

Nevertheless, my thoughts on your project:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe all ingested content for Fedora must be accompanied by either a FOXML or METS &lt;code&gt;.xml&lt;/code&gt; file so that it can be managed according to Fedora's digital object model.

This is true, but in practice many of the tools perform poorly because encryption is used in two ways: as well as full encryption (requiring a specific password to unpack a bytestream), encryption can be used to support obfuscation (where the encryption algorithm does not require a password, or only requires a known, shared, password). For example, PDF uses a default empty string password in some cases, and the JHOVE characterisation tool cannot distinguish between this and full encryption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second way of answering this question is as follows - are there any ways of spotting encryption &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. without understanding the format of the bytestream. The answer to this appears to be 'sometimes'. Methods such as the visualisation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://troydhanson.github.com/misc/Entropy.html&quot;&gt;bytestream entropy&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://corte.si/posts/visualisation/entropy/&quot;&gt;used to spot encrypted regions of files&lt;/a&gt;, and so this kind of information-theoretical analysis may be useful in some cases. Formally, however, encryption is statistically indistinguishable from compression, and therefore this approach will lead to a lot of false-positives in the presence of compressed data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There appear to be very few established tools that perform these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="438" LastActivityDate="2013-03-25T13:50:58.237" CommentCount="1" />

However, to avoid the slack space issue, you may want to consider which program you use to copy your files from one location to another. Presuming a program like &quot;rsync&quot; is only copying data that is part of the live file, you can just rsync the data from one folder to another folder on the device. Since all of the other free space has been zero'd out, there is no new data containing slack space that will be generated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;3) Once your files have been copied, delete the original files and re-perform step #1 to wipe out the newly created &quot;dirty&quot; unused space. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you complete the above steps, you will have a drive with the data files you want to send/leave, and all slack space will have been zeroed out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You HAVE to do a full disk zero wipe of the free space to ensure that no new data bearing slack space is created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, updated instructions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Go into the mounted filesystem&#xA;cd /Volume/MountedFileSystem/&#xA;&#xA;# Wipe the free space on the disk&#xA;dd if=/dev/zero of=./junk-file-containing-zeroes.dat bs=1000000&#xA;rm junk-file-containing-zeroes.dat&#xA;&#xA;# create a tar file containing just the data you want to send.&#xA;tar cfPp ./datafiles.tar ./&#xA;&#xA;# Delete the original files containing dirty slackspace&#xA;rm YourFilesAndFoldersButNotThatTarFile&#xA;&#xA;# Wipe up that new dirty space you just created!!

It will list the subjects of the book in order of prominence. There is usually an assigned Dewey classification as well which will indicate where a professional cataloger thought the book should go (science being in the 500s and history in the 900s). If there is no cataloging page, you can find cataloging information through the World Catalog (WorldCat) or the Library of Congress for most books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your own collection, you are of course not bound to the decisions of the catalogers who have pre-classified the book. In a library, the cataloger on staff may choose to move books to a location that makes more sense to the public being served. For example, books about space are in the 500s (science), books about rockets are in the 600s (engineering) and books about travel to extraterrestrial places are in the 900s (travel).
