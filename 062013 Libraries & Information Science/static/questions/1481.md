LIS-related podcasts
=====================
Is there a census of LIS-related podcasts out there? I know that Blake
Carver has posted his round-ups of blogs to follow at LISNews from time
to time such as the [2011
listing](http://lisnews.org/lisnews_blogs_read_2011) but I have not seen
such an effort for podcasts. Walt Crawford surveyed the blog landscape
in [The Liblog Landscape
2007-2010](http://www.lulu.com/shop/walt-crawford/the-liblog-landscape-2007-2010/ebook/product-18474093.html)
but he dd nothing in podcasts.

Is there a comparable work out there or does such not exist?

Here's David Lee King's
[List](http://www.davidleeking.com/2011/11/10/library-podcasts-you-might-find-useful/#.UXnTLMpkFZA),
also from 2011. King is the Digital Services Director for the Topeka &
Shawnee County Public Library and has written several books on libraries
in the digital age.

* Stephen Michael Kellat: David Lee King doesn't even include the LISNews Podcast, oddly enough.
The list is also two years old. Now I'm wondering if there is anything
newer than that.
