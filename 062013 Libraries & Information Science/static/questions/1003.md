Recording of conservation activities
=====================
[Question changed according to Jakob's suggestions]

Archival systems as
[www.axiell.co.uk/calm](http://www.axiell.co.uk/calm "CALM") offer the
possibility of recording conservation activities through one of their
modules. How widespread is this practice? When external/bespoke
solutions are used instead, how is interoperability achieved?

### Comments ###
* Jakob: This are three questions at once, so it's difficult to give a simple
answer. Would you consider reformulating the question to just one?
* Jakob: The answers to question two ("do conservators always use the
conservations modules [...]) and question three ("is interoperability an
issue?") are probably just "no" because hardly anything is \*always\*
used and interoperability is almost always an issue (among other
issues). I'd better remove these assumptions from the questions, ok?
* Eleonora: Thanks Jakob, I agree it sounded confused. I hope it's better now.
