Good examples of training or professional development programs for librarians to gain digital/tech skills
=====================
One the goals at MPOW is to help more librarians gain skills related to
conceiving, building, and maintaining digital projects. I'd welcome
examples of successful training programs for helping librarians gain
fluency with digital methods and tools.

I'm aware of more general opportunities such as the Digital Humanities
Summer and Winter Institutes ([http://dhsi.org/](http://dhsi.org/) and
[http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/](http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/)), or the Data
Management Roadshows in the UK
([http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/data-management-roadshows/](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/data-management-roadshows/)),
as well as programs like Stanford's "Tooling Up for Digital Humanities"
workshop series
([http://toolingup.stanford.edu/?page\_id=3](http://toolingup.stanford.edu/?page_id=3)).

Obviously, librarians can participate in any of these but I'm
particularly interested in library-specific examples.

Full disclosure: I helped created the Digital Humanities Winter
Institute (and would like to help make it useful to other librarians)

* Ashley Nunn: What sort of things would you want to see in a "good" training program?
That might help narrow it down some from just a list of any program
anyone comes up with.
* trevormunoz: I'm most interested in programs that tied digital/tech skill development
to the mission/tasks/workflows of librarianship. I would also like to
hear about how training programs in this area defined success and
measured it (though that might be a question in itself)
* jambina: i'm heading to DHSI on the weekend but not considering
librarian-specific training (as in, most librarians might not find this
applicable). i'm fortunate i do a lot of DH stuff so it makes sense, but
mostly so that i can understand my peeps better.

This is a hard question. For all the lip service paid to reskilling in
academic libraries, there seems to me to be very little evidence it's
happening, much less push to make it happen.

So the programs I know of are oldish and grassroots:

-   [23 Things](http://plcmcl2-things.blogspot.com/) and its many, many,
    MANY offshoots; if you're looking for wild successes, this is pretty
    much all you'll find
-   [Five Weeks to a Social
    Library](http://www.sociallibraries.com/course/), which is now more
    interesting for its delivery model than its content (disclaimer: I
    was part of this back in the day; if you have questions about it
    I'll be glad to answer them)

I know there's a passel of librarians helping each other through
[Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/) at the moment.

These aside, it seems to me that what you'll find is a haphazard
shedload of pre- and postconference sessions, the occasional IMLS-funded
weekend or week, and the occasional vendor-hosted installfest or
training session.

* trevormunoz: Thanks. 23 Things and Five Weeks to a Social Library are new to me.
* dsalo: Now that I think about it, I do know of a few libraries that are
diligent about internal just-in-time staff training via in-service days
and the like. College Library at UW-Madison is one such. The keys here
appear to be mandated attendance and clear learning outcomes (e.g.
"we'll be using Jing to help with chat ref, so staff must learn to make
quick screencasts with it and grab Jing links for posting in chat").

I am not sure the following is exactly what you had in mind, but here
goes.

Good examples of successful but (I think) no longer held workshops are
Cornell 5 day workshops in digitization and digital preservation. Those
were a great blend of theory and practice and the digitization tutorial
online is still useful (I actually use it all the time to discuss
digitization techniques and standards combined with my own institutions
best practices) though old.

Rare book school still teaches beginning TEI but their advanced TEI was
a really great class. I also heard great things about their EAD classes.

Archivists seem to have an easier time: SAA has a lot of classes on EAD,
Archivist's toolkit and now a whole Digital Archives Specialization.
I'll just say I looked at some training from LITA and i was interested:
like this class:
[http://www.ala.org/onlinelearning/management/classes/lita/webservices](http://www.ala.org/onlinelearning/management/classes/lita/webservices)

I have took one very focused class from Amigos a few years that was very
good, an online though synchronous class. It was a good way to try out
the technology. Lyrasis is the other big provider of classes, some of
which are online.

If you are a cataloger, there's a lot of training at different times of
the year. They have their own training culture which I am not that
familiar with. They all seem to be learning RDA, whether through
classes, webinars, etc.

I think the bottom line is these programs are expensive and unless its
something like RBS or SAA and you have a mission to educate, libraries
don't have the capacity to keep these going for very long. I think most
librarians I know who "keep up" try lots of different things including
classes at community colleges, workshops wherever they can find it (if
they have funding) and keeping up with Code4lib and listservs. There are
webinars through NISO and ASIST too.

I don't know what advice to give you, Trevor because I think its a big
question. I'd start with your own institution and see what training
would be useful there. I did the training that was useful for me: I
think that is the important thing. You won't be useful to everyone so
you might as well make the people at MD happy!

You might want to check out the [code4lib](http://code4lib.org)
community. There has been a yearly conference, interspersed with several
local meetings. There is also a good contingent of folks who
"multi-task" with an IRC chat window open, which is a great source of
inspiration and fun.
