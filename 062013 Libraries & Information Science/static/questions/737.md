How would classification schemes accommodate extraterrestrial life?
=====================
It is possible that some day we will discover proof of life outside
Earth, perhaps somewhere else in our solar system or perhaps on an
extrasolar planet. There will be many implications of this, especially
depending on the complexity of the life form, but I would like to know
how classification schemes and other methods of knowledge organization
would accommodate this.

For example, the [Library of Congress Classification
outline](http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/) of [Q -
Science](http://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/classification/lcco/lcco_q.pdf)
has QH for Natural history/Biology, with QH 301 - 705.5 for Biology
(General) and within that QH 359 - QH 425 for Evolution. This is only
about the evolution of life on Earth. Would the evolution of life on
another planet go here? Would other aspects of the science of the new
life go in Q? If it was an advanced kind of life, would its music go in
M and its art in N? Or would we add an entirely new section of the
scheme, in a new letter or letters, perhaps recreating the entire LCC
structure?

I would like to know if any serious (albeit currently theoretical)
thought has been given to this, and how best we could deal with this
question if it arises.
