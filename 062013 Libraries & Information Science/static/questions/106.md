Is it advisable to establish a DOI number for rare objects that won't change hands?
=====================
If a library has a collection of rare, non-book items, is it advisable
to establish a permanent digital record for these?

If the items are unlikely to change hands, does that influence the
decision?

* dsalo: Are these items in fact digital? If not, then a DOI makes no sense.
* jonsca: @dsalo That's what I thought, too, but from
[doi.org](http://www.doi.org/doi\_handbook/1\_Introduction.html) "DOI is
an acronym for "digital object identifier", meaning a "digital
identifier of an object". A DOI name is an identifier (not a location)
of an entity on digital networks. It provides a system for persistent
and actionable identification and interoperable exchange of managed
information on digital networks. \*\*A DOI name can be assigned to any
entity\*\* — physical, digital or abstract — primarily forring with an
interested user community or managing as intellectual property."
* jonsca: Maybe it's a misreading on my part
* dsalo: No, you're right -- but I still don't see what assigning a DOI to an
analog object achieves. What are you thinking it will help you (or
anyone else) do?
* jonsca: @dsalo I am by no means steeped in this field at all, so I could be way
off of the mark, I defer to your expertise
* jonsca: @dsalo For tracking and permanence of the record
* ksclarke: I could see the use if you are using it as an identifier within a system
that tracks your objects (digital and physical). Having a consistent
identifier scheme across digital and physical objects might be a
benefit.
* Chris Adams: I wanted to second @ksclarke's comment: it's incredibly useful to have a
single answer for how to identify things, no matter what they happen to
be: programmers love to have reliable primary keys and most programs
reflect that.

Personally, I think it's more practical to focus effort on managing your
URL namespaces so that your URLs can persistently identify your digital
resources. Tim Berners-Lee discusses the importance of this in his [Cool
URIs Don't Change](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html). The
advantage here is that people bookmark URLs, and will create links to
your content with them. It is in the best interests of your institution
that these URLs are stable, and can persist across content management
systems.

Fortunately there are lots of software options in the CMS and web
framework space that let you manage your URL namespaces. HTTP and DNS
software is widely deployed, and has lots of eyes on it, whereas DOI and
the [Handle System](http://www.handle.net/) which it relies on are niche
technologies that have only a handful of implementations.

My advice is to delay implementing anything like DOIs or Handles and get
your institution to instead have a plan for how it manages its URL
namespaces.

Another option might be to use [ARKs (Archival Resource
Keys)](https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/ARK).

The first page of that link explicitly says they are for physical
objects, too, and cites other advantages (e.g., you can mint your own
ARKs, once you've been assigned a Name Assigning Authority Number
(NAAN), for free (whereas DOIs cost)).

I do tend to think of DOIs as being for digital objects (despite the
note in the comments above that they can be used for any entity) and I
also tend to think of DOIs as being used for things which are published
(the DOI becomes a part of the citation). A physical object that is
owned and not transferred might not be considered a published item.

The California Digital Library has a brief [ARK vs. DOI
comparison](http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/ezid/doi_ark.html)
(comparing DOIs that are minted through DataCite).

And, use of an ARK doesn't have to run counter to the advice Ed gave
above. You can plan for patterned URLs that incorporate the archival
resource key, like UNT has done (for example):

[http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth61018/](http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth61018/)

* Ed Summers: ARKs are a nice halfstep between DOIs/Handles and managing your URL
namespace. My only beef w/ them is that the pattern for putting an ARK
in a URL uses the colon, which is a reserved character that needs to be
URL encoded. While this isn't a major problem since most browsers will
do the encoding for you, it can lead to subtle problems sometimes when
working with them programatically. At least they're not OpenURLs :-)
* ksclarke: True, if you are using patterns that extend beyond the ARK sometimes you
have to URL encode the ARK so that it stands alone/together within the
URL. For example, an image server that uses the IIIF Image API (draft)
might have URLs that look like:
\`http://images.org/service/ark%3A%2F38305%2Fg4t153vf%2Fis%2F1/80,15,60,75/full/0/native.jpg\`

I can add a bit of rationale for why formal, web-style unique
identifiers of whatever scheme might be useful for analog materials,
especially rare ones. It boils down to citation and linking.

Scholars and enthusiasts use these materials presumably, and they create
new works (written or otherwise) on the basis of them. In an
increasingly web-integrated and machine-readable world, the traditional
citation could be enhanced through the use of these unique identifiers.
They would point directly and unambiguously to your resource that was
cited or otherwise used in the new work, and provide a machine-readable
mechanism for pulling together various different uses of the same
material. Initiatives like the Open Annotation Collaboration
(http://www.openannotation.org/) would strongly benefit from such an
approach when used as a part of digital annotations or other secondary
works, even if your material that's being cited or used is not (yet?)
digital.

That's not to say this is easy - identifier management is indeed quite
hard. I agree with Ed that a coherent namespace policy is the key, no
matter which particular identifier scheme is implemented. Know clearly
what it is you're identifying (oops, there's the FRBR rabbit hole) and
know how you're going to assign and maintain those identifiers. You'd be
way ahead of the curve in doing this, but it's a direction I see the
community going in strongly for the next while.

I'm looking into this question and similar questions in the museum space
right now.

Here are some of the best clues I've come up with so far:

[http://museumid.net/documentation](http://museumid.net/documentation)

[http://www.cidoc-crm.org/URIs\_and\_Linked\_Open\_Data.html](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/URIs_and_Linked_Open_Data.html)

[http://ispiders.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/biodiversity-informatics-needs-business.html](http://ispiders.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/biodiversity-informatics-needs-business.html)

[http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2011/04/content\_negotiation\_for\_crossr.html](http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2011/04/content_negotiation_for_crossr.html)

I wouldn't call Handle and DOI exactly niche technologies. Yes, there
are a limited number of implementations - but look how big those
implementations are, and what kind of (meta)data they are being used to
exchange.

Rare books are an edge case between library and museum best practice.
There's actually a data model for that: FRBRoo - see e.g.
[http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbr\_papers.html](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/frbr_papers.html)

Although as you rightly note, rare books are (hopefully) unlikely to
change hands too much, there are other reasons you might want to
register them separately and maintain the data somewhere centrally -
principally to do with mobility of the (meta)data rather than the actual
source item - and of course, how about persistence of any digitised
versions there may be?

It would be very interesting to see what can be done with linked data
and DOI in future now that this has been kick-started somewhat.
