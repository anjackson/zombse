=====================
Public libraries are libraries with the primary purpose of serving
members of the public rather than, e.g., members of a specific
institution or organization.

This is part of a non-overlapping categorization of libraries along with
academic/college libraries, school libraries, government libraries,
corporate libraries, and the rare subscription libraries. Some large
public libraries are also research libraries.

This tag should be used to indicate questions about public libraries as
an institution or that would almost exclusively occur in the context of
public libraries.
