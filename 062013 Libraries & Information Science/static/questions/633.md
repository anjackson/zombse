=====================
Structured data that includes many relationships between unique
identifiers. Each resource is identified by an HTTP URI, which can be
used to retrieve information about the resource and links to other
resources in RDF format. Relationships have links types from Ontologies
and the set of all connected linked data is also known as Semantic Web.
