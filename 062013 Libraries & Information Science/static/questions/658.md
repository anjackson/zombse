=====================
Institutions or repositories dedicated to the long-term storage and
preservation of materials, usually of a unique and historical nature or
with the assumption that it will have that nature in the future. If you
have a question about the process of archiving materials, including
selection, acquisition, and physical preparation for long-term storage
and access, use [tag:archiving] instead. See also:
