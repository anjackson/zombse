title : Alternatives to barcodes for book identification

Alternatives to barcodes for book identification
=====================
Barcodes are cheap and they work, but they often also cover up parts of
the book's cover. They could be stuck to the inside, but this is often
inconvenient.

I've often been wondering **what alternatives there are for identifying
who borrows which books?**

There are several considerations to think of:

-   Impact on book (does it cover something? hinder something?)
-   Price of installation
-   Reliability
-   Ease of use
-   Bonus features

* Joe: One advantage (bonus feature?) to bar codes -- it's a pretty universal
identifier of 'this is a library book' and/or 'this has been removed
from circulation' when it's been struck through.
* Henrik Hansen: @Joe if you are interested, please write up a whole answer! Explaining
the ups of barcodes would be great :)

An RFID tag is less visually intrusive than visible barcodes; it doesn't
need to be placed on the outside of a book for circ-desk ergonomics,
either, so it can be put on the inside of the cover. The price is
somewhat higher, and while nearly every library has barcode readers
sitting around, fewer have RFID readers sitting around, so you'll have
initial costs for purchasing and installing the readers and training the
circ staff. There will also be a transitional period while you convert
your collection to RFID.

Many of these concerns applied to your library when it first automated
its collection and converted its card catalog, of course. You'll have to
decide whether the usefulness of RFID is worth its cost in effort and
funding.

One final thought: converting to RFID won't help the books you've
already got barcodes on. You'll likely have to leave the barcode
stickers where they are, even if you do add an RFID tag. But the books
you add to your collection in the future can have the full cover
visible!

[dsalo](http://www.kcoyle.net/jal-31-5.html) was kind enough to suggest
["Management of RFID in Libraries" by Karen
Coyle](http://www.kcoyle.net/jal-31-5.html) and allowed me to integrate
that suggestion into my answer.

[RFID tagging](http://www.rfid-library.com/en/default_e.html) is one
option. (I am in no way affiliated with the site linked here.)

There is, however [some
concern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rfid#Libraries) with RFID tags:

There are ways around these concerns, though - making sure the tags are
coded in such a way that they only have meaning when related to the
library's specific database system, for example.

### Comments ###
* Henrik Hansen: I'm really unsure of how privacy issues come into concern with
identifying books. Yes, some tags could be read from hundreds of meters
away (note that it's \_some\_ tags; most can't), but even if that is
possible: So what? How is that going to matter? Someone knows which book
you got?
* Ashley Nunn: @HenrikHansen There is some concern over patron data being shared.
* Peter Murray: @HenrikHansen The privacy concern that I have hear is one of user
tracking. The identifier of the book is unique so it is theoretically
possible to track the holder of the book through a space. Think about an
environment where there are RFID readers well placed; without knowing
who the user is, his/her movements could be tracked through the space.
It is also possible to tie readers to video cameras and other devices to
get an image of the user in the space.
* warren: rfid tags can also be removed more easily by the patron

It's not just a matter of covering things. Barcodes have the benefit of
being human-readable, offering easy identification even when reading
equipment misbehaves. Also, whenever they're handled by library staff,
they're taking at least a cursory glance at the book in question.

RFID tags are an entirely different beast. They can be placed in an
unobtrusive way, and are thus subjecting the book to a more honour-based
system, especially if combined with patron-operated "self-check"
borrowing and returning units. Fraudulent users can manipulate the
system to avoid having the book registered onto their own account with
very little creative thinking.

Sloppy programming or human interface design can lead to other sources
of error, including tags reprogrammed with errant information. Since
there's little evidence making the error imminent the moment it happens,
it's gradually deteriorating the credibility of the data base to a
certain extent.

Also, we're gluing these hardware stickers with a limited life-time into
media we're expecting to last way beyond the lifetime of the sticker.
The sticker usually doesn't carry any additional, human-readable
identification, so the moment it fails to answer the reading device, the
book will have to be re-identified and re-tagged manually.

As to the original concern: even placing the sticker inside the book
doesn't warrant that it doesn't cover information. I've seen archived
catalogs of art where there was no white space inside or outside of the
brochure, and the sticker covered a substantial part of both imaging and
text.

Then there are privacy concerns. "Who borrows which book" is a question
we're not really allowed to ask. "Which books get borrowed more
frequently than others" would be a valid question, but any kind of "who"
going beyond general user groups is going to be problematic.

### Comments ###
* Henrik Hansen: The "who" in my question was not meant for tracking, but for
identification. I.e. so borrowers can look up which books they got and
libraries can contact the borrower. I've seen some books and magazines
have a custom, removable cover with the barcode on. Of course, you can
remove the content, but at least it doesn't cover information. Thanks
for the insight!

In most libraries I've seen, there are two distinct functions of
spine/cover labels:

1.  Show the call number for easy shelving and retrieval.
2.  Uniquely identify the item for circulation, as with a barcode.

It seems to me that function \#2 can be accomplished with RFID, if you
want to invest in it, or with barcodes on the inside cover, if you don't
mind the wear and tear on both the items and the circ staff's hands.

But function \#1 requires that the label **must be visible on the
spine** in order to work properly. Perhaps what we really want is for
the covers of library editions to be slightly altered so that a standard
amount of space (perhaps 40mm) at the bottom can be covered without
obscuring other information, like this:

Saying so is much easier than getting the publishing industry to start
doing it, though.

* Peter Murray: Interestingly, there is an ISO standard for putting information on spine
labels: [ISO
6357:1985](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso\_catalogue/catalogue\_tc/catalogue\_detail.htm?csnumber=12665)
"Documentation -- Spine titles on books and other publications". It is
currently up for systematic review. Part of the abstract says: "It
includes rules for allocating a space on the spine, to be used for
library identification purposes, and rules for the use of edge titles."

In the UK at least it is absolutely normal for barcodes to be positioned
on the inside of the book. This doesn't always avoid the problem of
obscuring important parts of the book - something I've noticed
particularly, although not uniquely, on children's board books where the
covers inside and out are an integral part of the content.

In my experience RFID tags tend to be larger than a standard library
barcode, and of course can have a unique ID for the item printed on them
as a alphanumeric, barcode or both - for exactly the reasons mentioned
in the answer from Tatjana. However, because of their larger size, in
items where it is impossible to attach a tag without obscuring some part
of a picture or text the situation is worse than with the smaller
barcode.

When I was young my local public library used a photographic charging
device (detailed here
[http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/5579/librarytrendsv3i2i\_opt.pdf?sequence=1](http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/5579/librarytrendsv3i2i_opt.pdf?sequence=1))
which captured a photographic image of the item and the patron's ID. One
could imagine a modern version of this combining high resolution images
with very small representations of the items unique identifier
(microdots anyone?) - which would minimize the amount of the item
covered by the representation of the ID.
