Uses for International Standard Name Identifiers?
=====================
ISO published ISO 27729 earlier this year, see
[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso\_catalogue/catalogue\_tc/catalogue\_detail.htm?csnumber=44292](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44292)

The standard describes the ISNI - International Standard Name Identifier
- "whose scope is the identification of Public Identities of parties:
that is, the identities used publicly by parties involved throughout the
media content industries in the creation, production, management, and
content distribution chains." (Taken from
[http://www.isni.org/](http://www.isni.org/)).

Does anyone a) have heard of it or b) has plans to use this?

* cpikas: and what is the connection, if any, to ORCID?


Answer by Ed Summers

It looks like there is (at least one) pointer from the ISNI database to
VIAF:

[http://isni.oclc.nl/DB=1.2/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&IKT=8006&SRT=&TRM=ken+follett](http://isni.oclc.nl/DB=1.2/CMD?ACT=SRCHA&IKT=8006&SRT=&TRM=ken+follett)

which points at:

[http://viaf.org/viaf/64005683/](http://viaf.org/viaf/64005683/)

It's too bad the links to ISNI aren't present (yet) in the VIAF RDF data
though:

[http://viaf.org/viaf/64005683.rdf](http://viaf.org/viaf/64005683.rdf)

It was mentioned by Graham Bell (EDItEUR) last week at the Library
Linked Data seminar in Florence. See slides
[http://leo.cilea.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/5487/5979](http://leo.cilea.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/5487/5979)
(slide nr. 24). And:
[http://www.editeur.org/39/ISNI/](http://www.editeur.org/39/ISNI/)

So I guess EDItEUR might tell you more

As I understand ISNI, it's meant to be a superset of VIAF, ORCID, and
whatever other name-authority controllers choose to buy in. ISNI is
supposed to work a little bit like domain names; the main ISNI
International Agency can bless "Registration Authorities" which do the
actual handing out of identifiers.

ISNI seems to have originally grown out of the media licensing
industries, but my sense is that they'll work with anyone who has a need
for authority control.

About one year ago, Thom Hickey (OCLC) blogged a nice
[article](http://outgoing.typepad.com/outgoing/2011/07/viaf-and-other-ids.html)
clarifying main differences and commonalities between ORCID, VIAF, and
ISNI.
