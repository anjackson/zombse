=====================
Institutions or repositories dedicated to the long-term storage and
preservation of materials, usually of a unique and historical nature or
with the assumption that it will have that nature in the future. If you
have a question about the process of archiving materials, including
selection, acquisition, and physical preparation for long-term storage
and access, use
[archiving](/questions/tagged/archiving "show questions tagged 'archiving'")
instead.

Specific forms of archives or otherwise overlapping concepts, such as
[digital-collections](/questions/tagged/digital-collections "show questions tagged 'digital-collections'")
and
[special-collections](/questions/tagged/special-collections "show questions tagged 'special-collections'"),
may have their own tags. Please use discretion when applying more than
one of these. However, there is no general taxonomy for archive types as
there is for library types.

This tag roughly matches:

-   JITA class [DL.
    Archives](http://eprints.rclis.org/handle/10760/3660)
