A unified approach for finding research articles
=====================
I'm a bit stymied and I'm hoping that there is likely to be an obvious
solution to my problem: how can I efficiently monitor what is being
published in particular areas of science?

Right now, my solution is to maintain a bunch of journal RSS feeds for
sources relevant to my interests. However, this doesn't tell me much
about other (possibly unknown) sources, so I supplement with 20 or so
Google Scholar Alerts for existing articles, which is helpful but is
overly specific.

The frustration occurs that the journals don't do a very good job of
maintaining their feeds and I have feeds and alerts in different
applications (I also use Papers2 to maintain my PDF library but lacks an
RSS reader).

I have a hard time believing that this has not already been solved.

Presumably you are looking for a free source. If you have access to a
pay-for database vendor (such as STN, Scifinder, Dialog etc.) then you
can set up very precise alerts. I used to use the email alerting
services of the journals - they were reliable, possibly more so than RSS
feeds. With careful programming of a mail program such as Outlook, you
could even automatically emphasize or sort into folders messages
containing key words (e.g. halogenation or pyridine).
