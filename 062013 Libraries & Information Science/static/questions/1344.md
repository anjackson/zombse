Which is the most comprehensive online reference centre for digital preservation resources?
=====================
Many different projects and people publish digital preservation papers
each year, in lots of different journals, conferences, on institutional
websites etc. Trawling the web on dp research missions can be time
consuming. So I'm wondering which is currently the most comprehensive
and up-to-date online portal for digital preservation publications.

I know of several personal collections - eg using
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/digitale_langzeitarchivierung/),
[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/groups/1704161/digital-preservation-cost/),
Delicious etc,

The organisational ones I used to use don't seem to be updated anymore -
[PADI](http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/10691/20110824-1153/www.nla.gov.au/padi/index.html)
certainly isn't, and the Dutch National Archives' [Digital Preservation
Knowledge
Centre](http://en.nationaalarchief.nl/knowledge-base/digital-preservation)
doesn't seem to have been updated recently.

Which are people currently relying on, if any?

The Digital Curation and Preservation Bibliography by Charles W. Bailey,
Jr., aims to be pretty comprehensive. It's a formal bibliography in the
traditional style, which takes time and labor to prepare (many thanks to
the author for his dedication), so I'm not sure how frequent the updates
are but it is still being maintained.

Like the previous commenter, I use Charles Bailey's bibliography and
would also recommend it. Since the demise of PADI its pretty much the
only source that tries to collect all published material.

The other thing you could do is set up an alert in Google Scholar. Lots
of info about how to do that is here:
[http://scholar.google.com.au/intl/en/scholar/help.html\#alerts](http://scholar.google.com.au/intl/en/scholar/help.html#alerts).
I have one set up for "digital preservation" and that sends me one or
two emails every week listing all new publications which match the
search criteria. Its not perfect but its certainly very useful.

My latest OA e-book (2012) is the Digital Curation Bibliography:
Preservation and Stewardship of Scholarly Works
(http://www.digital-scholarship.org/dcpb/dcb.htm). See also: Research
Data Curation Bibliography
(http://www.digital-scholarship.org/rdcb/rdcb.htm) and Digital Curation
Resource Guide (http://digital-scholarship.org/dcrg/dcrg.htm).

The NDIIPP program (digital preservation) at the Library of Congress
keeps an updated list of its partner publications at:
[http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/multimedia/publications.html](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/multimedia/publications.html)

And the overall site at:
[http://www.digitalpreservation.gov](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov)
serves as a portal for a wide range of information and resources
concerning digital preservation, and it is updated regularly.
