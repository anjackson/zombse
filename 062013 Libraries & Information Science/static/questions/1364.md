How much of a library’s collection never circulates?
=====================
In a recent blog article about the question "[How Much of the Literature
Goes
Uncited?](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2012/12/20/how-much-of-the-literature-goes-uncited/)"
I just found this question. The author argues that the answerdepends on
the observation period and the universe of observation, so there is no
simple answer. There should be, however, typical answers to typical
library scenarios, studies in library and information science, or
guidelines for collection development.

The 80/20 rule generally applies here: 80% of the library's collection
is used 20% of the time, and vice versa. It can vary depending on the
focus of the collection and the relevance to user needs. A general
research library is more likely to collect on a "just in case" model,
whereas a more focused specialized library is going to collect a
narrower range of "just in time" material, and probably weed more often
so that the remaining materials are the ones that are being used most
often already.
