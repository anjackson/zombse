Do American Mathematical Society and Academic Press have ebooks for subscribers?
=====================
I know that link.springer.com offer ebooks downloadable to subscribers.

Do American Mathematical Society and Academic Press have ebooks for
subscribers?

Thanks!

Short answer: **Yes**, but maybe, **No**, depending on what you really
need.

They have their Contemporary Mathematics and various conference
proceedings series available in an PDF format. This is divided into a
separate backfile (1980-2011) and a frontfile eBook collections (2012,
2013) see:
[http://www.ams.org/publications/ebooks/ebooks](http://www.ams.org/publications/ebooks/ebooks)

AMS has a sampling of electronic books accessible as individual PDFs:
see their history of mathematics section at:

[http://www.ams.org/samplings/math-history/math-history](http://www.ams.org/samplings/math-history/math-history)

These are freely accessible.

As always, evaluation is probably going to be specific to your
institution, so do go for a trial and share your experience widely.
