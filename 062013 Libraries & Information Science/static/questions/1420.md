Is there a community like hacker news for librarians
=====================
As you might know there is community called [Hacker
News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) for software developers (hackers)
that they discuss the hottest stories in the world about their field
(programming and technology). Even people can ask questions that
normally are considered off topic in `StackExchange` websites and get
opinionated Answers. Is there an similar community or website for
librarians?

* Ashley Nunn: Hi Arash! There are a number of blogs and the like - [Library
Journal](http://lj.libraryjournal.com/), among others - where you can
usually find up to date interesting library related stories.
Unfortunately, as this is a perfect example of the types of list
questions that do not work well on the SE network. See [Good Subjective,
Bad
Subjective](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/),
and [Real Questions Have
Answers](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/)
for more helpful guidance! :)
* Arash Milani: Thank you @AshleyNunn for the \`Library Journal Link\`. and for noting
about the question itself.
* ksclarke: I'm not sure I see how this was a subjective question. It wasn't "What's
the best library programming news site out there?" but "Are there any
sites like X." The X there is a very specific kind of site (not a
judgment on the value of those types of sites). Seems like a valid
question to me.
* ksclarke: So, for instance, an answer might have mentioned
http://news.librarycloud.org/ which is the most like the mentioned site
in format (but also noted that it's not that widely used). It might have
referenced the Code4Lib.org community (which has a mailing list, IRC,
aggregation of blogs, etc., but not so much a news site) as a possible
alternative to the Hacker News format. It also might have mentioned the
reddit libraries community: http://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/ (which
probably attracts more of the techy type).
