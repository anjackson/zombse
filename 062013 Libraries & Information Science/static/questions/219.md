I consider "lapsit storytime" another way of saying "baby storytime."
Basically in a lapsit/baby storytime one shares songs, action rhymes,
and a book or two with adults and their babies (kids somewhere in the
0-18 months range, perhaps). There is often playtime and the babies
rarely stay confined to laps, although it's a secure place to start, and
including "lapsit" in the name highlights the concept that the storytime
is fun and cuddly, emphasizing adult/child bonding and interaction.

Lapsit/baby storytime gives the babies a chance to hear lots of
language, and the families opportunities to connect with each other.
Basically it can have most of the typical storytime elements, but geared
to babies' development, and with a bit of a focus on helping the
caregivers develop skills and a repertoire. A librarian may focus on
such things as:

-   welcoming families to the library (for many with babies it's their
    first visit, or their first with children) and assuring them that we
    don't mind babies' chaos, noise, or propensity to chew on things
-   modeling interactive language moments
-   encouraging adults to share songs, rhymes and stories with their
    babies
-   sharing the [early literacy
    benefits](http://www.multcolib.org/birthtosix/earlyliteracy.html) of
    doing so
-   sharing [other
    research](http://www.multcolib.org/birthtosix/braindev.html) about
    babies' language and pre-literacy development (in a fun, [concise
    way](http://www.multcolib.org/birthtosix/babies.html))
-   supporting and encouraging caregivers' roles in baby language
    development
-   providing age-appropriate materials such as board books (especially
    in black and white or with photos of babies' faces, for the youngest
    ones) and song sheets

But fundamentally the same principles hold true as with other
storytimes: have fun, share books, develop literacy and language!
