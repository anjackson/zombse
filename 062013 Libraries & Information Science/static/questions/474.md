=====================
Digital humanities (DH) is "[analyz[ing] broad swathes of human
experience in ways that weren't feasible before computers and digital
materials](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/a/414/345)" as well as
applying humanities techniques to digital objects. For a more in-depth
discussion, [the current Wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities) is likely to have
an up-to-date summary of this evolving field.

This tag is a general subject tag, describing a general field within the
broad topic of "libraries and information science" that a question might
fall into rather than necessarily describing something that the question
is specifically about. For example,
[tei](/questions/tagged/tei "show questions tagged 'tei'") (the Text
Encoding Initiative) is a specific standard within a sub-field of
digital humanities; a question specifically about TEI might then be
tagged both "TEI" and "digital humanities." (This practice is
particularly helpful to those who might want to follow a single broad
field tag rather than try to think of every specific item it might cover
and follow all of them.)

*Humanities computing* is an older term for the field which became
digital humanities.
