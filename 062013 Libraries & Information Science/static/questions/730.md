Good Encoded Archival Description (EAD) books, tutorials, boilerplate?
=====================
I'm a beginner when it comes to [EAD](http://www.loc.gov/ead/) (had a
metadata design studio class in grad school where we modelled EAD in
SKOS/XML), but I'm looking at starting the archivist certification
process and I'm wondering what EAD books, tutorials, boilerplate, etc.,
are good resources for learning/reference. Any suggestions?

The [EAD
roundtable](http://www2.archivists.org/groups/encoded-archival-description-ead-roundtable)
of the Society of American Archivists maintains links to a wealth of
information from their website. In addition to basic information about
EAD, the website contains several sections that are very interesting and
enlightening.

The SAA Standards Committee also maintains the [Standards
Portal](http://www2.archivists.org/standards), which has a [section on
EAD](http://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-encoded-archival-description-ead/encoded-archival-description-ead)
and links to additional resources and tools.

The roundtable has also compiled an [EAD
bibliography](http://www.zotero.org/groups/ead_bibliography) on Zotero.

The [official EAD website](http://www.loc.gov/ead/) is hosted by the
Library of Congress and contains the latest version of the tag library
and crosswalks.

For examples, if you have a copy of [Describing Archives: A Content
Standard](http://www.archivists.org/governance/standards/dacs.asp)
handy, there's an example in the appendices. If not, they're not
difficult to find online (The [Online Archives of
California](http://www.cdlib.org/services/dsc/tools/ead_toolkit.html),
for example, has its own EAD template as well as many additional
resources).
