Which reporting interfaces in current ILS systems provide shelf-order lists with normalized LC call numbers?
=====================
Most reports dump directly into an excel, which does not handle LC call
numbers well.

Innovative Interfaces, Inc. has an inventory module that can produce
shelflists in call number order using either DDC or LC.

Both Koha and Evergreen store a normalized form of the call number in
addition to the display form. The normalized form can be used in each
system's respective reports interface to sort LC call numbers in correct
order. The normalized call number can be included in CSV or Excel dumps
of report output as well.

An example of a Koha report definition that sorts by normalized call
number can be found
[here](http://wiki.koha-community.org/wiki/SQL_Reports_Library#Call_Number_Shelflist).

In addition, Koha's inventory function will sort call number lists based
on the normalized call number.
