What controlled vocabularies do exist for the topic "Digital Preservation / Digital Curation / Long Term Access"?
=====================
I maintain a [Zotero
bibliography](https://www.zotero.org/groups/digitale_langzeitarchivierung/)
about digital preservation for personal use and started thinking about
sharing it with peers. For this reason it would be necessary to get some
structure into it. Beneath a classification scheme with about 15
categories (which is not so hard to create) some kind of controlled
vocabulary (glossar, subject list) concerning the field of digital
preservation would be quite helpful.

In the course of my research I stumbled upon the following material:

-   The "Topic Index" in [DPC's Preservation
    Handbook](http://www.dpconline.org/pages/handbook/)
-   SAA's Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology (which seems to
    be a bit too broad)

Does anybody know other examples? Maybe even in german?

Excellent question! Are you familiar with PADI? It's a 'gateway to
international digital preservation resources', previously maintained by
NLA with input from DPC and Nestor. Their list of topics is pretty
comprehensive and could be used for your purposes.

The list was developed over several years in response to the subjects
and topics that were being addressed by the DP community. PADI isn't
updated any more, but their list of subject headings is still very
relevant - looking at it again, they even refer to it as the PADI
Thesaurus.

See

* Roland Lukesch: Thank you! I started categorising my material using the PADI Thesaurus,
adding new categories where needed. For the subject indexing I need
something more granular, maybe ANZ's Glossary.

Another promising glossary from the Archives of New Zealand, described
as "The Glossary of Terms is a compilation of legislative, digital
continuity, digital preservation and Continuum Recordkeeping terms."
