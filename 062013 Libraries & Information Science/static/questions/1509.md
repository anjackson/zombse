How to store information as topics and query its metadata with facets
=====================
I'd like to collect and store personal but technical information in
topics, which is a common approach that allows topics to stand alone and
potentially be combined.

I want to use a standard such as XML or another text-based format (to
future-proof the work), and possibily use a popular standard such as
DITA.

What I'd like to do after that is be able to retrive the information
that I store as metadata with facets, in a similar way that many
websites use.

I'm not a developer and don't have access to a CMS. What is the simplest
way to do this?
