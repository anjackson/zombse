What classifications of people's interests exist?
=====================
I know [the North American Industry Classification
System](http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012)
for categories of businesses. Is the a similar classification of
subjects people are interested in?

For instance: pop music, computer science etc.

<ul class="tags"><li class="tag">public-libraries</li><li class="tag">classification</li><li class="tag">databases</li></ul>

* Jakob: People may also be interested in businesses, so where do you draw the
line between what people are interested in and "other" topics? In the
end you are looking for a classification of everything, aren't you?

The taxonomy company Wand, Inc. has an [Arts, Crafts, and Hobbies
Taxonomy](http://www.wandinc.com/pdf_documents/breakdowns/arts_tax.pdf).
It is not freely available, however.

Referring to Jakob's comment on your question, look at the [LoC
classification outline](http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/) for an
attempt to classify nearly everything.

And similarly to Matt Stephenson's answer, because people can be
interested in anything, you need a classification system that handles
anything, and the [Dewey Decimal System](http://dewey.info/) does that.
It's like NAICS because it's only numbers, and the longer the number the
more detailed and specific is the subject in question.

Another option, that's in words and not numbers, is the [BISAC Subject
Headings
List](http://www.bisg.org/what-we-do-20-73-bisac-subject-headings-2011-edition.php),
which is used in bookstores.
