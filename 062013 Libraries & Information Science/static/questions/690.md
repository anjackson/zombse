How do you automate collection of electronic resource usage statistics?
=====================
My current workflow for analyzing our database usage statistics is
pretty unideal: I visit a set of administrative web pages, sign in,
download reports, & paste into a master spreadsheet. Some resources
allow me to email monthly reports to myself. I know there's a better way
to do this, specifically the
[SUSHI](http://www.niso.org/workrooms/sushi/) protocol which even has a
pretty extensive list of [available
tools](http://www.niso.org/workrooms/sushi/tools).

However, looking through that list, a few tools are for SUSHI servers
not clients, a few more are SDKs & not actual software, & the others
seem either outdated or deep in alpha. I downloaded Serial Solution's
MISO command-line tool & while it runs the demo fine, it chokes when I
try to put in our EBSCO SUSHI credentials. It also only runs on Windows
which is obnoxious. I think the only other usable item on the list is
JISC's SUSHIStarters but that seems to still be in alpha & requires more
configuration.

Tl;dr - what cheap or open source ERM tool do you use to collect your
e-resource usage stats? I'm not opposed to a paid product but I'm
assuming that most of the proprietary ERM solutions are out of my (very
small) college's price range.

### Comments ###
* Joe: If everything's available as webpages, you might be able to handle it
similar to a screen scraping job. Something like Perl's
[WWW::Mechanize](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Mechanize)
([examples](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Mechanize::Examples))
could help to automate the process.
* phette23: The biggest problem is that's a Perl script, not a UI. It'd take some
serious work to get that pulling stats from several password-protected
sites. [Coral](https://erm.library.nd.edu/) is the only open source
SUSHI software I can find, & Serials Solutions' 360 & [Scholarly
Stats](https://www.scholarlystats.com/sstats/default.htm) seem to be
subscription services. Anyone with experience have a recommendation?
