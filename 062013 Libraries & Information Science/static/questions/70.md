Re-classification of small (<25,000 items) library from Dewey to LC...thoughts?
=====================
I'm the director of two community and technical college libraries- one
is Dewey, the other LC. We are going to make the switch to LC next
summer, but in the meantime, I'm trying to find out some specifics
regarding companies who will clean up MARC records and assign the LC
numbers (and possibly produce the new labels as well). Does anyone have
suggestions?

[Marcive](http://home.marcive.com/) specifically mentions
[reclassification](http://home.marcive.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=51&Itemid=30)
on their website. I also found [Duncan Systems
Specialists](http://www.duncansystems.com/recat.htm) (that's their page
on reclassfication) with a quick Google search though I had not heard of
them before.

Coming from a fairly small (â‰ˆ60,000 items) comnity college library, I
can say from experience that Marcive did a good job cleaning up
inconsistencies in our catalog. We weren't moving from one scheme to
another, however.
