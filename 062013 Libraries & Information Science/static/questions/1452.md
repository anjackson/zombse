Mapping openurl 0.1 to 1.0
=====================
Our link resolver sometimes gives us openurls using version 0.1 and
sometimes using version 1.0. Our UI passes these on to other services,
like Illiad. It would be nice to hand off something that always follows
the same format, so I'm considering writing a Python library that
converts 0.1 to 1.0. Is there a document I can use as a guide that maps
the keys from 0.1 to 1.0? Or perhaps just listing those that changed
between the two versions?
