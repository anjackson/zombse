What is the best way to preserve Microfiche content?
=====================
What is the best way to convert microfiche so that the content is
preserved and accessible without a microfiche reader?

* Ashley Nunn: Do you have a specific way you want to view it? (I am assuming
digitally, but do you have any other requirements?)
* johntait.org: Not particularly. Microfiche readers are becoming obsolescent and
microfiche itself is fairly fragile, so I'm looking for the general
approach.
