How to detect invalid permutations of MARC fields, subfield, and indicator
=====================
I'm working on a web app that allows users to run checks on each MARC
record in a MARC batch file, so they can quickly assess the quality of
those records. The idea is when batches of records are received (like
for shelf ready books), they can generate a report of records to
inspect, based on likely indicators of poor record quality.

Some examples (from our cataloger) include:

-   If the record status (leader/05) is not 'c' or 'n', the record might
    be incomplete.
-   If the record field 300\$a contains "p." or"v." or "pages", but no
    numbers.
-   If none of the subject fields (6xx) has a second indicator of 0
    (meaning no LC headings are included)

Users need to be abel to create their own reports, so I'd like to create
a form that helps users build queries by suggesting /validating valid
permutations of Fields, subfields and indicators. It shouldn't suggest
or allow users to create a check for 245\$q because that is (hopefully)
not going to exist in any record.

The [MARCXML
schema](http://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/schema/MARC21slim.xsd)
doesn't validate to that level of detail. Can I find this data in a
format I can use programmaticly?

Combinations that of presence or absence occur with very low frequency
are almost always incorrect.

There have been some studies from UNT and OCLC; you can get more
accurate results by on record type, tag/tag conditional frequencies,
etc. Using something like Apriori style association-rule mining can be
quite useful.

It is fairly easy to get a list of the theoretically valid tag/subfield
combinations by parsing the LC pages (the format is quite rigid).

Many theoretically legal combinations are so vanishingly rare that they
are almost certainly errors. Warning for combinations that have never
been used in your collection has a fairly low false positive rate.

* Jakob: Can you please reference the studies you mention?

You may be able to make use of the Perl modules MARC::Lint [1],
MARC::Lintadditions [2], and MARC::Errorchecks [3], either by directly
or by examining the code to develop the checks/validation you wish to
perform.

[3]

Please let me know if you have any questions on the modules.

Thank you

* bibliotechy: Looks like this [list of MARC
fields/subfields/indicators](http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/EIJABB/MARC-Lint-1.45/etc/ecbdlist.html)
is exactly what I was after. Thanks.
* Bryan Baldus: In that case, it's probably best to get it directly from the source:
