Ebooks: to be checked out from a library no more than 26 times?
=====================
In an article at
[http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/07/business/la-fi-ebooks-20110307](http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/07/business/la-fi-ebooks-20110307)
it is said that some publisher

> does not allow its e-books to be checked out from a library more than
> 26 times. After that, the license on the e-book will expire, and
> libraries will have to decide whether to buy a new one.

The article was written at March 07, 2011. Does someone know the state
of that attitude concerning ebooks - is it common practice? Which
publishers do this?

Are libraries aware of this? Differ the practice in different countries
(I am in particular interested in Germany)?

Every library buying ebooks from HarperCollins is affected.

* jonsca: Could you give a brief summary or short quote from the pdf so that if
the link goes dead, the answer will still stand on its own? Thanks.
* Joe: here's the english version :

(for some reason, it's not as simple as changing 'de' to 'en' ... you
also have to convert underscores to dashes))
* dr0i: Summary in English " Harper Collins sell libraries eBooks that can only
be loaned out 26 times before having to be repurchased,[...] " , in
German: ". Harper Collins vertreibt eBooks an Bibliotheken, die nur 26
Mal ausgeliehen werden können und danach neu erworben werden müssen
[...]".
