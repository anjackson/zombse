What kinds of activities can a library faculty research fund support?
=====================
As part of helping to better market a research fund for library faculty,
I'm looking for examples of the kinds of activities/costs that such
funds at other research libraries support to help librarians do
research/publish research. Do such funds mostly fund travel to research
sites or conferences? To pay page charges for Open Access publishing? To
purchase equipment or supplies for research.

Please share links to public documentation of the work of faculty
research funds if available.

George Mason University Library's [Fenwick Fellow
program](http://infoguides.gmu.edu/fenwickfellow) provides office space,
dedicated collections money, and additional non-earmarked funds to a
local faculty member.

Wisconsin's [Grants-in-Aid
program](http://library.wisc.edu/friends/grants-in-aid.html#grants) is
run by the Friends of the Libraries, and supports a month or two of
humanities research in the Madison area.
