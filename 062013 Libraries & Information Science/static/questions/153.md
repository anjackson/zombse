What attempts, if any, have been made to catalogue and archive threads on Internet forums?
=====================
There is a significant amount of useful information available on
Internet forums, and it can be really frustrating when these forums get
deleted and a *huge* amount of extremely useful information gets
permanently lost.

Is there anywhere (online or otherwise) that has attempted to catalogue
or archive Internet forum threads?

Archive.org, unfortunately, fails to archive much of the material off of
heavy Ajax-based websites, and also fails to archive much of the
material that's on online forums.

* Flimzy: Are you asking for a \*comprehensive\* archive? Or individual archives
for specific forums?

lists](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/684/do-libraries-archive-mailing-lists-as-part-of-their-collection)

It's mostly up to the discretion of site administrators to backup
content and in some cases publish them.

Many online forums or message boards consist of a high percentage of
noise, and it makes little sense to preserve post of little value.
Valuable forum posts can be *selectively* preserved as text files or
screenshots.

* David Rothman: Agree with Ambo, but it is important to note that this topic is going to
come up more and more in the future. Remember in 2010 when the Library
of Congress decided to archive Tweets?

groups.google.com came from their acquisition of
[DejaNews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Groups#Deja_News), which
had archived Usenet postings.

I know there are plenty of organizations out there which will subscribe
to mailing lists or similar, and then build their own archives. Some are
reasonable (eg, [mail-archive.com](http://www.mail-archive.com/),
[gmane.org](http://gmane.org/)), but others seem to just want to serve
ads along with the pages ... and you can get so many websites doing it
that a search for some error message turns up the exact same mailing
list thread on half a dozen web archives.

Oh ... and for mailing lists relating to library science -- check out
Eric Lease Morgan's [Electronic
Serials](http://serials.infomotions.com/) archive.

Many of the massive web forum sites get caught up in the Internet
Archives work. For example, when I was doing research on discussions on
the web forum rpgmakervx.net I was thrilled to find that a massive
amount of the content was also saved in the Internet Archive. For
example, [you can see the forums in 2009
here](http://web.archive.org/web/20090217225755/http://www.rpgmakervx.net/).
In practice, this actually meant that I could not only find old
discussion threads, but also see edits and changes over time to those
discussion threads.

Aside from that, some sites, like Stack Exchange, [actually provide data
dumps](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/),
which would make it really easy for groups to collect this content.

Nearly every website, at every point in time.
[http://archive.org/web/web.php](http://archive.org/web/web.php)

It's like magic.

* InquilineKea: I wish you were right, but unfortunately, archive.org's coverage is
extremely sparse these days. :(
