Reference on document types
=====================
I work at a research institute focusing on cultural heritage. We are
studying the development of a document management system and I am
carrying out some informal research about document types. Our goal is to
establish a system of document types that allows us to classify and
organise the documents that are relevant to us, most of which we are
probably using already. By "document type" I mean categories such as
"letter", "book", "instructions manual", "meeting agenda", "research
article", etc.

Is there any standard, guideline or reference that establishes a
complete and thorough hierarchy of document types? It doesn't need to be
especially geared towards research organisations, but that would be a
plus.

* Joe: Are you looking for something to help you to evaluate which formats to
use in your system? If so, I'd recommend LoC's [Sustainability of
Digital Formats](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/), although
I know it's not complete (it doesn't include
[FITS](http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/) ... but that's another thing on my
todo list)
* Bill Dueber: There are complexities here that you'll want to think about before
dedicating yourself to a list, too -- what is the document type of a
pamphlet that was bound into a book, which was then put on microfilm,
and the microfilm digitized? Oh, and if you come up with a good set of
guidelines -- publish it :-)
* CesarGon: @Joe: That is not the main goal; current practice will probably
determine that. The main goal is to classify and organise the documents
that we are already using. Editing to clarify; thank you.
* CesarGon: @BillDueber: Yes, I am aware of such complexities. Thanks for reminding,
though. I'll definitely post my findings here. ;-)

There are several classifications of document types but no single
standard. The problem is that the type depends on context. Imagine
someone asked you about "person types" to classify people; what would
you say? I examined the same question a year ago and I could find a
[collected
classifications](http://jakoblog.de/2011/04/07/was-ist-ein-publikationstyp/)
(article in German), among them:

-   [Dublin Core Resource
    Types](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/)
-   [BibTex document types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX)
-   [RDA
    extend](http://metadataregistry.org/concept/list/vocabulary_id/169.html)
-   [DINI Publication

    (German)
-   [RSWK Form

    (German)
-   [Bibliographic Ontology

-   [Publication Type
    ontology](http://wiki.surf.nl/display/standards/info-eu-repo#info-eu-repo-Publicationtypes)
    (anyone actually using this?!)
-   [NSGL Publication Types](http://nsgd.gso.uri.edu/pubtype.html)
-   [PTC Publication

-   ...

Maybe it's better to first clarify the criteria ("facets" in information
science terminology) you want to classify documents into.

### Comments ###
* Joe: I think 'factes' may be a typo for 'facets', but the way it's presented,
I'm not sure if it's a new term I'm not familiar with.
* CesarGon: @Jakob: Thanks, I'll have a look at those. Regarding the criteria of
what we mean by "document type", well, I guess that's part of the
question too! Do these guidelines or standards suggest any particularly
suitable criteria to classify documents?

Are you looking for a list of MIME types? (For example mpeg, mp4, RAW,
are video MIME types.) There's a master list here:
[http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html)

If you're looking for the file extensions for the mime types, you can
google that but I'm not aware of anything completely comprehensive, and
it doesn't seem like there's a registry for that. Some file extensions
are used for more than one mime type.\
 See
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\_media\_type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type)

### Comments ###
* CesarGon: No, I am not looking for MIME types or file extensions of formats. I am
interested in documents in the abstract sense of the word rather than
the implementation details of computer files.

It seems that you're looking for guidance on records management for your
research project. Establishing records management policies and
procedures can help you:

-   Identify record series (groups of records, based usually on the
    function of the records, e.g. Correspondence or Laboratory
    Notebooks);
-   Identify who is creating records;
-   Identify who is responsible for organizing and maintaining records;
-   Where multiple copies of a record exist (in the same or different
    formats), identify the copy of record; and
-   Establish a retention schedule (determine how long records should be
    kept).

A good records management program will help your project demonstrate the
authenticity of research data and products, establish intellectual
property rights, and satisfy requirements established by funding
agencies and legislation (such as open access policies and privacy
laws).

A good introduction to the management of research record is JISC's
*[Guidelines on Managing Research
Records](http://www.jiscinfonet.ac.uk/partnerships/records-retention-he/managing-research-records)*.
It divides research records into four types: records documenting the
research process, records documenting research outcomes or products,
records documenting the management of the research process/product(s)
and research data. It then provides guidance on the management, storage,
access, retention and destruction of research records.

Examples of research records management policies include the University
of Melbourne's [Policy on the Management of Research Data and
Records](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/records/research.html) and Barts and
the London's [Records Management of Research Project
Records](http://www.bartsandthelondon.nhs.uk/assets/docs/research_records_guidance.pdf).

### Comments ###
* CesarGon: Not really. We are looking for a document type system, rather than a
research record management system. Thanks anyway.
