Can Amazon's recommendation engine be licensed for library use?
=====================
Many users are in a rush to use the library, but some are still able to
spare some time to explore the library's collections. Aside from
perusing the shelves directly, it would be convenient for patrons to be
able to find similar items of interest.

Is it possible to license Amazon's book recommendation engine for use
with a public or university library's online catalog, or for use as a
separate program (as it might be a systems integration nightmare to
retrofit it to an older catalog system)?

I believe Amazon still uses an item-to-item collaborative filtering
method ('people who bought this book also bought these other books!').

Details in this article:
[http://www.win.tue.nl/\~laroyo/2L340/resources/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf](http://www.win.tue.nl/~laroyo/2L340/resources/Amazon-Recommendations.pdf)

Given that, it really shouldn't be too hard to create a similar
system...or build one from an existing open source solution like

I think LibraryThing for Libraries is what you're looking for!

* David Rothman: Oh yeah- that's a great idea! I'm curious, though- this uses the
LibraryThing API, right? What happens if LibraryThing (Gawd forbid) goes
down?
* David Rothman: Also, it isn't free and it'll only work with items that have an ISBN.
* KatieR: I don't have any personal experience with LibraryThing, unfortunately. I
came across it while doing a project about social media and OPACs during
my graduate program.

I think you can use Amazon's [Product Advertising
API](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html)
to provide suggestions. It mentions "Similar Products" as one of its
services. I can't tell from their page whether it's a paid service or
not but it's probably free.

*Edit*: I thought I had seen the Product Advertising API in use and I
finally remembered where. Jason Clark of Montana State University has a
beta "[BookMeUp](https://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/files/bookme/)" app
that uses the API to suggest another book to read based on search
results. He's also released [the source code on
Github](https://github.com/jasonclark/BookMeUp) if anyone wants to reuse
it. I couldn't find the license but much of his other work is under the
GPL. It's not clear to me why this hasn't moved out of beta; it seems
pretty polished. It points users to Amazon as an end point so it doesn't
seem like it would violate the terms of the API.

We looked into using Amazon reviews a couple of years back but, at that
time, it was against Amazon's TOS to use their content without the
primary purpose of its use being to send traffic/sales to Amazon. We've
tried multiple times to get Amazon to discuss with us licensing options
for any of their content but Amazon has never been remotely interested
in working with us.

* eby: this is still the case: \_(ii) in accordance with the terms of this
License Agreement and within the express scope of the license granted in
Section 6; and (iii) to send end users and sales to the Amazon Site. You
will not use the Product Advertising API, Data Feed, or Product
Advertising Content with any site or application, or in any other
manner, that does not have the principal purpose of advertising and
marketing the Amazon Site and driving sales of products and services on
the Amazon Site.\_
