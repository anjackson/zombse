What, if any, non-statutory factors of fair use exist and are likely to be used as precedent in the future?
=====================
The four statutory factors are as follows:

> 1.  the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
>     is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational
>     purposes;
> 2.  the nature of the copyrighted work;
> 3.  the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
>     the copyrighted work as a whole; and
> 4.  the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
>     the copyrighted work.

(17 USC ยง 107)/p\>

This list of factors is explicitly non-exhaustive, so there is the
potential for "surprise" factors. However, any such factor that is not
sui generis presumably has a precedent in post-1976 case law and an
obvious application beyond the bounds of its specific case. What, if
any, such non-statutory factors exist and are likely to be used as
precedent in the future?

"Transformative use" seems to be one such not-entirely-statutory factor.
That's what got search engines out of trouble for making thumbnail
images ([Kelly v
ArribaSoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_v._Arriba_Soft_Corporation)).

Another non-statutory factor is the emergence of fair-use guidelines for
various sectors of cultural industry. This started with the [Documentary
Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair
Use](http://www.centerforsocialmedia.org/fair-use/best-practices/documentary/documentary-filmmakers-statement-best-practices-fair-use),
which succeeded so well at making formerly-uninsurable documentaries
viable that quite a few others have popped up, including the recent
[Code of Best Practices for Fair Use in Academic and Research
Libraries](http://www.arl.org/pp/ppcopyright/codefairuse/index.shtml).
Apparently judges give some weight to common fair-use practice, so
codifying same can be (limitedly) protective.

* dsalo: Completely coincidentally, today I happened across a paper in SSRN that
argues for the consistency and sanity of fair use, and mentions
transformative use as well:
