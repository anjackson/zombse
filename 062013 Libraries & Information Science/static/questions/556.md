SPARQL endpoints for library catalog data or other metadata?
=====================
I've found the following SPARQL endpoints for library-related data:

-   Library of Congress of Chile: [endpoint
    here](http://datos.bcn.cl/sparql)
-   OCLC's dewey.info: [endpoint here](http://dewey.info/sparql.php)

Surely there must be more endpoints out there, for catalog data, other
library metadata, and library vocabularies than this? Where else should
I be looking?

The Data Hub seems to be a good starting point for datasets with SPARQL
endpoints. There is a group of datasets called "Bibliographic data".

[http://thedatahub.org/group/bibliographic?res\_format=api%2Fsparql](http://thedatahub.org/group/bibliographic?res_format=api%2Fsparql)
gives the datasets in that group, but only the ones with a SPARQL
endpoint.

This is listed on the Data Hub site, but is worth calling special
attention to.

The British National Bibliography is available via a number of APIs,
including SPARQL. These APIS are documented
[here](http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html).

The URL for the endpoint is bnb.data.bl.uk/sparql .

The German National Bibliography is available as RDF, but is not
currently front-ended by a SPARQL endpoint. I suspect they probably have
a few pilot endpoints running internally. The
[DNB](http://www.dnb.de/EN/Service/DigitaleDienste/LinkedData/linkeddata_node.html)
are available, but with search only via SRU and OAI-PMH at the moment,
but since you can bulk download, you can make your own endpoint.

* dsalo: Heh, making my own endpoint is more work than I'm prepared to do for my
simple purposes. I just want to work up a SPARQL exercise or three for
late in my databases/SQL-for-future-librarians course. For that I need
endpoints!

Cambridge has an endpoint here for a partial snapshot of its data.

We've also added a tutorial to SPARQL based around bib data and the
endpoint.

* dsalo: Yay tutorial! Bookmarked, thanks; that makes it a lot easier to plan a
lesson.
