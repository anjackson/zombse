How can libraries considering shared print archiving ensure access to collections as well as preservation?
=====================
The idea of shared storage for print collections is an important one as
many libraries reassess the use of their on-site physical space. How can
libraries considering shared print archiving ensure access to materials
in shared collections stored elsewhere. This is related to interlibrary
loan services and off-site storage but not identical to either.

Examples of existing agreements about shared print planning with
information about what points libraries should be sure to cover in
making new agreements would be especially welcome.

WEST is one example of this; lots of details available online:

Formal shared print agreements typically spell out two things: 1) who
will have access, and 2) what kind of use or delivery will be supported.
For example, access and delivery policies may specify that the physical
volumes may only be provided to participants in the the formal agreement
and may only be used "in-library" to minimize risk of loss or damage.

The Center for Research Libraries (CRL) is developing a database of
information about shared print programs known as the Print Archives
Preservation Registry (PAPR). You don't need to be a member of CRL to
use it. The CRL website contains a preliminary list of shared print
agreements that have been developed by existing programs.

The currently-available PAPR database is a prototype. Soon it will be
replaced by a more sophisticated system developed for CRL by the
California Digital Library.
