=====================
The Library of Congress Classification is a
â†‘[classification](/questions/tagged/classification "show questions tagged 'classification'")
that was first developed in the late nineteenth century to organize the
collection of the
[library-of-congress](/questions/tagged/library-of-congress "show questions tagged 'library-of-congress'").
It was influenced by
[ddc](/questions/tagged/ddc "show quesons tagged 'ddc'") and
[cutter](/questions/tagged/cutter "show questions tagged 'cutter'")
classification. The LCC notations are used as base of LOC call numbers.
See the [Wikipedia article on
LCC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification)
and [the LOC website](http://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/classification/)
for further information.
