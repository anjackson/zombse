How much metadata to display for spatial datasets?
=====================
I have a growing library of environmental and economic spatial data.
Some sets cover the earth for decades, others are localized and span a
few months. On a landing page, what are effective ways to communicate
this range of possibilities to my users?

Some will be experts and some will be seeing GIS interfaces for the
first time. I want to provide an interface that inspires more
exploration than a simple table would.

In this case, I think the "how much" is less important than the "how
*displayed*." There's quite a lot of impressive GIS landing-page design
out there. For a good example, try [this interface to the David Rumsey
map collection](http://rumsey.mapranksearch.com/). For a less-good one
(sorry, UConn, not picking on you, honest!) try [this
layout](http://magic.lib.uconn.edu/historical_maps_midwest.html), which
is quite common and quite horrible.

It really depends on what type of spatial data it is.

I typically group things into one of three categories:

1.  Data about regions (eg, GDP by country / population by state)
2.  Data about points in space (eg, temperature / wind speed at a
    recording station)
3.  Images of a region (eg, satellite imagery)

For \#3, I believe the norm for images of the Earth is the
[FDGC](http://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards)
standard, which is being rolled into ISO 19115. (if it's not on Earth,
you'd want to use [WCS (World Coordinate
System)](http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html)).

I'm not sure on the other two, but I'd look at [OGC (Open Geospatial
Consortium)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/is), although I
think they're more interested in web services to retrieve data.

For interfaces, for \#2 (and maybe \#1), I'd look at something like
[Socrata OpenData](http://www.socrata.com) which is being used by
[data.gov](http://www.data.gov/) ([map
example](https://explore.data.gov/Federal-Government-Finances-and-Employment/Google-Map-of-DC-Closures/hkc4-tg49)),
where you can switch between tabular view & points on a map.

For \#2 and \#3, I believe you can put them into
[KML](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/) and use Google
Earth (or [NASA World Wind](http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/)) to
overlay them (it might support \#1, too) I've seen some really cool
visualizations of atmospheric data taken by planes, where they had it so
you could 'watch' the plane's flight (and view it from different angles
as it looped around).

...

As for showing people what you have ... I'd be inclined to do a map-like
interface, with markers on it showing what places you have data about.
You might put some other controls to filter it down (by date, by type of
data), which would reduce the number of markers on the map.
