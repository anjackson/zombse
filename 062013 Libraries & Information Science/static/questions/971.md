Why doesn't Zotero import the language field from an article COinS?
=====================
The language field (rft.language) is defined in The [OpenURL Framework
for
Context-Sensitive](http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=82).

If it is why Zotero could not retrieve language from
[COinS](http://ocoins.info/#id3205609421)-based site that specify it
with that field? To give an example, Zotero does not fetch language of
following:

    <span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3aofi%2ffmt%3akev%3amtx%3ajournal&rfr_id=info%3asid%2focoins.info%3agenerator&rft.genre=article&rft.atitle=aa&rft.jtitle=bb&rft.title=aa&rft.language=fa"></span>

But can get language of following:

    <span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Adc&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Focoins.info%3Agenerator&rft.title=a&rft.language=b"></span>

If you remove article from first it will be fetched. What is the
solution? Also see following page that have this issue:

### Comments ###
* dsalo: I can think of a few possible reasons, but I can't really troubleshoot
without an example. Could you link to the site that's failing you? (This
may also be a better question for the Zotero user forums.)
* Ashley Nunn: Can you give us some more information here? The more information and
examples you can give us about your problem, the more likely it is that
you will get an answer that is helpful.
* Ed Summers: It's so sad to me that people still talk about COinS. But it's par for
the course I suppose.
* PHPst: @EdSummers Why that is sad for you?


Answer by Jakob
----------------
Zotero does know about the language field in COinS. It implements
interpretation of COinS in the JavaScript file `openurl.js` - this also
includes [the language in
rft.language](https://github.com/zotero/zotero/blob/master/chrome/content/zotero/xpcom/openurl.js#L433).
I guess there is something wrong with the COinS that you try import in
Zotero but not with Zotero.

* Jakob: COinS is used to encode and extract metadata. You can read about it and
create it [here]( http://generator.ocoins.info/) including language. If
you still have problems to import a particular metadata then provide a
link!
* Jakob: \`translators/COinS.js\` in Zotero makes use of
\`Zotero.Utilities.parseContextObject\` as defined in \`openurl.js\`.
Please just accept my answer so we can close this discussion.
* PHPst: Thanks, Question updated and a link is provided. Where can I find a list
of all COinS item types and their attributes that are officially
standardized ?
* phette23: I don't think COinS itself has item types, it is just a way of embedding
OpenURL data in HTML. The best list of OpenURL types I can find is in
the [KEV Implementation
Guidelines](http://library.caltech.edu/openurl/StandardDocuments/KEV\_Guidelines-20041209.pdf)
[.pdf]: journal, book or general document, dissertation, patent, &
scholarly service type (no idea what that means). More generically,
dublin core as well as "non-text & other metadata formats" are offered.
That pdf is from 2004, other types may have been standardized since.

Answer by PHPst
----------------
Using @Jakob comment, Current Zotero OpenURL parser just fetch Language,
description, subject ... fields if the item type defined as dc (Dublin
Core). It seems that openurl.js should be modified.

see:
[https://github.com/zotero/zotero/blob/master/chrome/content/zotero/xpcom/openurl.js\#L433](https://github.com/zotero/zotero/blob/master/chrome/content/zotero/xpcom/openurl.js#L433)

Zotero is merely following the OpenURL specification. The KEV format for
[info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal](http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler/extension?verb=GetMetadata&metadataPrefix=mtx&identifier=info%3aofi/fmt%3akev%3amtx%3ajournal)
does not allow language, nor do the [KEV
formats](http://alcme.oclc.org/openurl/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&set=Core%3aMetadata%20Formats)
for anything but info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dc (Dublin Core).
