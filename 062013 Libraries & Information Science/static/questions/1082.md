* jonsca: Hi Reza, as mentioned before on one of your other questions, consumer
questions about reference systems are off-topic here. This is a site for

professionals.

No, that link refers to the citation style localizations. The Zotero
client's localizations can be found in the Firefox Extension's locales
folder. See
