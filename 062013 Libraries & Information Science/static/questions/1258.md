Help locating a library
=====================
This question may be deemed off-topic, but I am looking for the location
of a particular library. ![The one in this
picture](http://i.stack.imgur.com/XClBy.jpg)

I have tried reverse image searches and following the picture back
through various websites/tumblrs. I believe it is a library because of
the alphabetical signs at the top of the shelves. But is it public?
Private? Where is it?

Any help appreciated!

* jonsca: Hi NiceOrc, as you suspected this isn't really within the scope, sorry.
That is an interesting shelf, but perhaps it might have been in a
fictional piece or something?
* Mary Jo Finch: St Florian Library, Austria! Found through Google Image reverse search.
* NiceOrc: Thank you so much!
