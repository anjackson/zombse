Are there preservation issues with plastic book jacket covers?
=====================
We have received a hardcover book, the dust jacket of which is wrapped
in plastic cover. (We are not sure of the precise composition of the
plastic, if that matters.) Do such plastic covers usually have any
long-term preservation issues themselves, and if so, how can they be
ameliorated? Might the plastic pose any long-term risk to the underlying
dust jacket or the book, and likewise, how might such issues be
ameliorated?

The type of plastic used is the deciding factor:

-   PVC (older books) = **mild acidity**
-   Polypropylene (newer books) = **acid free**

A quick Google search will find a number of vendors selling archival
quality Polypropylene covers :)
