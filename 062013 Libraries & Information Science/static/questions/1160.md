What types of information found through a library "primary" and what is "secondary"
=====================
What is the difference between "primary information" and "secondary
information", specifically as it applies to genealogy research using a
library's resources?

I'm operating on the assumption that you mean "primary sources" and
"secondary sources."

Primary sources are those which are original information, such as
artifacts, documents, etc. that were created with direct knowledge of a
situation, often under created during the time under study. This can
include things like census data, immigration records, birth
certificates, etc. Secondary sources cite or comment on primary sources,
but this distiniction isn't always hard and fast.

See, for example, the [Wikipedia article on primary
sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source) or [this
page](http://www.princeton.edu/~refdesk/primary2.html) from the
Princeton University Library.
