How can one find out popularity of publishers in library collections?
=====================
This question arose from [a question about print on demand
books](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/754/purchasing-print-on-demand-books)
in libraries. I tried to find out how many libraries have books of print
on demand publishers, such as [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/),
[Blurb](http://www.blurb.com/), and [BoD](http://www.bod.de).
Unfortunately I was not able to do such search in WorldCat. So the
general question is how to search for publishers in library collections
to find out whether the books of a publisher can be found in many
libraries or not.

In Worldcat.org there's a publisher index available. It's probably what
you want: ["pb:blurb"](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=pb%3Ablurb),
["pb:lulu"](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=pb%3Alulu).

The supported list is buried in the Help. See:

* Jakob: Thanks! It's not that obvious from the [advanced
search](http://www.worldcat.org/advancedsearch).
