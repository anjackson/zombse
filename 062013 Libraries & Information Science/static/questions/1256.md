What is the difference between digital-media and e-resources?
=====================
I was about to suggest to merge the tags
[digital-media](/questions/tagged/digital-media "show questions tagged 'digital-media'")
and
[e-resources](/questions/tagged/e-resources "show questions tagged 'e-resources'")
but I am not fully sure. Is there a commonly agreed upon difference
between both terms? I think the term e-resources is only used in
libraries to refer to [digital
media](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media). Wikipedia has only
an article about [electronic resource
management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_resource_management)
(ERM) which could also be named "management of digital media".

I know this distinction only from Ex Libris, a vendor of library
software. For example:

> Unified resource management: Alma supports the entire suite of library
> operations for print, **electronic, and digital resources**
> ([http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/AlmaOverview](http://www.exlibrisgroup.com/category/AlmaOverview))

In this context, "electronic resources" refers to digital material an
institution can license from a publisher and which is transferred to the
library / the user on request. "Digital resources" on the other hand
typically refers to files you actually own yourself and which are stored
in an institutional repository or filesystem.

Personally, I find the wording of this distinction counter-intuitive.
But in essence, it is justified, because it helps to distinguish between
two types of materials which are processed in quite different library
workflows (electronic resource management vs. repository management).

* Joe: It's possible that 'digital-media' may also include physical digital
volumes (eg, CDs, CD-ROMs, DVDs, DAT, DLT) ... but there's still the
assumption that the library has it, vs. it being licensed and
distributed from some third party.
