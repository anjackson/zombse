Are UK libraries finding their catalogues able to cope with the new cookie regulations?
=====================
We are currently investigating our websites and services for compliance
with the new regulations. I'm wondering if others have performed a
similar audit and can report on any problems with their OPAC, Discovery
service or any other element of their LMS stack.

Has anyone had a response from their LMS vendor on this issue
(pro-active or otherwise?)

be able to do something like [JISC](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/) has with
their pop-up message.

This isn't an LMS, but I did happen to notice on Twitter that the
British Museum have a
[page](http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_this_site/terms_of_use/cookies.aspx)
up about the cookies in use on their web properties.

To me the telling features are:

1.  Currently, no penalty, no enforcement. Perhaps because...

2.  UK Government websites (amongst others) almost uniformly
    non-compliant.

See:

My own opinion is that the law is obviously stupid. If the user does not
intend to accept cookies, by all means, disable them in the browser.
