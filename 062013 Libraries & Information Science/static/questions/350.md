Need high-quality young adult book list to compare to YALSA list
=====================
The university where I'm a librarian will soon be involved in a teaching
licensure program, and one of my summer projects is to make sure the
library's juvenile collection supports the curriculum. I've been
collecting various award lists for children's books to glean the
multiple award-winners. I'm trying to do the same with Young Adult books
but not having great success. YALSA has a list, but I need to find
another high-quality, authoritative list to compare it to.

* KatieR: I know you're asking about Young Adult books but one of my favorite
award lists for children books is the Theodore Seuss Geisel Award
(http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/geiselaward). "The
Geisel Award is given annually to the author(s) and illustrator(s) of
the most distinguished American book for beginning readers published in
English in the United States during the preceding year."
* Ashley Nunn: Are there any specific award lists you are looking for? Or do you just
want as many lists as possible? Do you want it for multiple years, as
well?
* Melissa: I want authoritative lists (not just personal or library compilations)
for multiple subjects and years. There are a lot of specialty lists --
I'm looking for general. Thanks for asking.
* Melissa: Thank-you all for your suggestions -- I've been able to use several. I
may have a new expertise ;). Anyone interested in a comprehensive list
of suggested/award-winning books for children and young adults?
* dsalo: Couldn't hurt. Might be a good way to seed a new wiki?
* Joe: You could always answer this question w/ the comprehensive list + check
'community wiki' so that others can edit/add to it. (and then mark it as
the accepted answer, so it'll show up at the top)

[CCBC Choices](http://www.education.wisc.edu/ccbc/books/choices.asp)
might be a place to start. Back issues are available [from Wisconsin's
institutional repository](http://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/6571).

[The Horn Book](http://www.hbook.com/) has good reviews & guides and
they also have the annual [Boston Globe-Horn Book
Awards](http://www.hbook.com/resources/boston-globe-horn-book-awards/).
Many states or regions (as dsalo points out with Wisconsin) have awards
or reading lists or guides. For example, the [Massachusetts Book
Awards](http://www.massbook.org/bookawards.html) has a children & YA
section for their award. You could also consider awards given out by
other groups, such as the [SIBA Book
Award](http://www.authorsroundthesouth.com/siba-book-awards) from the
South Independent Booksellers Alliance. And while they are a retailer,
[Junior Library Guild](http://www.juniorlibraryguild.com/) tends to pick
highly regarded YA books.

We often check out the CYBILS, Children's and Young Adult Bloggers
Literacy Awards to get ideas for great YA lit.

These titles might not be in your collection development sphere, but I'd
certainly make sure to have a link to YALSA's [Alex
Awards](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/booklists/alex). These are adult books
that really do appeal to teens.

To get multiple awards, you may be able to try a reader's advisory
database, such as Novelist, if your library subscribes to one. They
often let you browse the awards, or, in looking up a book you can see if
it's won multiple awards.

Right now, a similar database, the Reader's Advisor Online is available
online for free and their "browse" feature allows you to select awards:
[Reader's Advisor
Online](http://www.readersadvisoronline.com/lu/RAbrowse?topic=132)
Unfortunately, I can't see a way to limit this to Young Adult awards
only, so you may have to use your best judgment in narrowing them down.

The British library organization, Chartered Institute of Library and
Information Professionals (CLILIP) has its own awards, you can see
winners here:

Also, many states' library associations have their own YA awards, not
sure if there is any one place to see them together, might have to do a
state by state search? Good luck!

The [Award Annals](http://www.awardannals.com/) website collects lists
of awards and ranks books based on how many they've received. They have
sections for different genres including [Young
Adult](http://www.awardannals.com/v/Honor_roll%3aYoung_Adult_books), so
it may be helpful for your purposes.
