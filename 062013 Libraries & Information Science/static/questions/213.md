What enhancements are available for integration into OPACs?
=====================
What vendors offer enhancements that can be incorporated into existing
OPACs (online public access catalogs) or discovery layers? I'm
specifically interested in enhancements that can appear in traditional
catalogs without having to buy an additional discovery layer.

* KatieR: This is a really, really open and a better answer would come up if you
were more specific with what discovery layers/enhancements are wanted.
* Verbeia: The answer below would make a great tag wiki for the opac tag. But as a
Q&A, it is way too broad.
* Gem: What is a tag wiki? I was originally thinking this should be a community
wiki but it looks like that has been deprecated in recent stack
exchanges? The reason I asked the question is because our library is
interested in knowing about \_ALL\_ possible enhancements, even ones we
hadn't previously considered a need for.
* Joe: @Gem : it's just a description for a given tag, so you don't end up w/
people using it for polysemous terms. Of course, we need someone w/ 1500
rep to approve the edits, so even Dorothea is going to need another day
or two.

Incorporates a "did you mean" option into the OPAC. Last I checked, it
worked with SirsiDynix's Horizon HIP and Symphony.

Another option would be to go with an open source catalog discovery
layer that has some of the tagging, faceting, and other interface
enhancements you are interested in. My library is about to implement
VuFind, and we plan to use it to replace the OPAC offered by our ILS
vendor.
