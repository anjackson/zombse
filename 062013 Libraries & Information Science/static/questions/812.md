How to fix mold (mildew?) smell and possible foxing?
=====================
An item has been donated to the library which, for various reasons, it
would be preferable to repair/preserve rather than replace/reject.
However, it has a mold (mildew?) smell throughout and possible foxing on
both paste-downs, although not elsewhere. (See image below or click
through to a high-res copy [here](http://i.stack.imgur.com/yqJhW.jpg).)
What is the normal preservation/repair option for this problem?

Have you tried baking soda (bicarbonate of soda)? I have tried this with
a non-valuable book, mainly to see how it would work\*. I stood the
book, fanned open, inside a large plastic bag with a dish of baking
soda, making sure the soda didn't touch the book at all, then sealed the
bag. I left it for two or three days and by the end of that time the
smell was faint enough that the book could go back into the collection.

(\*Bad cigarette smoke smell, we were going to discard the book but
thought we would see how the baking soda worked.)

* M. Alan Thomas II: Might help with bad smells in general, but I'm not sure it's going to
ensure the death of anything eating at the book.
* NiceOrc: Sorry, didn't realise there was a vermin problem too. I've never used
borax, but I'm told it kills bugs as well as deodorises. Anyone know how
it affects books?

Please note: I am not an archivist and do not work with sensitive
materials. If it's truly a valuable book, it would be work having a
professional appraise & recover it.

Vinegar and sunlight work wonders on mold. You can either use a fine
mister or wipe white vinegar onto the molded portion. Leave in direct
sunlight. Repeat. It may take several applications of vinegar and
sunlight.

I do not know how this will affect the book & its cover, however.

Direct sunlight is the best solution for moldy books, along with air
circulation, but you don't want to expose a book to direct sunlight for
more than an hour or so a day. If you're concerned with the smell, put
the book in a container with baking soda, so that the baking soda does
not directly touch the book, (box within a box, for example.) as NiceOrc
mentioned.

If the mold is dead and dry, a toothbrush and a very weak vacuum can
also help. Just make sure to keep your lungs protected.

is a pretty good quick reference for mold solutions.
