=====================
The process of archiving materials, including selection, acquisition,
and physical preparation for long-term storage and access. If you have a
question about archives as institutions or that would usually occur only
in the context of an archive, use
↑[archives](/questions/tagged/archives "show questions tagged 'archives'").

Specific forms of archiving, such as
↓[digital-archiving](/questions/tagged/digital-archiving "show questions tagged ital-archiving'")
and
↓[web-archiving](/questions/tagged/web-archiving "show questions tagged 'web-archiving'"),
may have their own tags. Please use discretion when applying more than
one of these.

Specific steps in this process are not unique to archives or archiving
and have their own tags; e.g.,
[preservation](/questions/tagged/preservation "show questions tagged 'preservation'")
