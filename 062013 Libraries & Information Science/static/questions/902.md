Where do formal citations in scientific publications originate from?
=====================
There are [zillions of citation
styles](http://citationstyles.org/styles/) to reference publications,
especially in academic writing. Browsing late 19th century journals I
was suprised by the lack of formal bibliographies and references, as
usual today. When and how were they introduced in scientific
publications? Is there a history of citation styles?

Im am not interested in the evolution of particular citation styles but
in the evolution of the idea of formal references in scientific
publications. It looks like until the 19th century it was common to just
refer to "the recent results" instead of citing a list of specific
articles with author, title, journal, pages etc. Citation styles are
usual no later than [the
1960s](http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=citation+style&year_start=1900&year_end=2000&corpus=0&smoothing=3),
the introduction of citation analysis by Eugene Garfield may also have
had an impact. I guess that formal citations got obligatory during the
early 20th century, but when and how?

### Comments ###
* Ashley Nunn: Is there a specific style you are interested in? Or do you want just a
general overview of the beginning of citation styles, period? The
history of each style would be an incredibly long and convoluted answer,
considering, like you said, there are "zillions".
* Jakob: I am interested in a general overview. For instance when did which
journal introduce guidelines or how many percent of articles had formal
citations in which year.
* KatieR: Is this a question related to the library profession? It sounds more
like a reference question. I am not 100% sure that citation styles and
rules are decided upon by librarians. I realize librarians, in some
situations, teach how to do citations but is there a roundtable or
committee made of librarians that create citation rules? Input on this
would be helpful since I am a little ignorant on the subject.
* Jakob: Citation analysis and bibliometrics is an area of library and
information science since the late 1950s. I am interested in how
citations as explicit references evolved before this time.
* Joe: I assume you've read Garfield's 1954 "[Association-of-Ideas Techniques
in Documentation: Sherpardizing the Literature of
Science](http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/papers/assocofideasy1954.html)"
and Weinberg's 2004 "[Predecessors of Scientific Indexing Structures in
the Domain of
Religion](http://web.archive.org/web/20070124201826/http://www.chemheritage.org/events/asist2002/11-weinberg.pdf)].
Admittedly, they're more about citation indexes. You might also look to
see if any local libraries have Samuel C. Bradford's 1948

* Trevor Owens: It's an interesting question. One that I would be interested to know an
answer to. Related, there is a good bit of historical work on the
history of the footnote as a citation device (ex
http://www.amazon.com/The-Devils-Details-History-Footnotes/dp/0743241754/ref=pd\_bxgy\_b\_text\_b).
I believe the Chicago Manual of Style goes back to 1905.
* Bill Lefurgy: There is a timeline for the "history of citation" at
http://www.xtimeline.com/timeline/History-of-Citation that begins in
1498.
