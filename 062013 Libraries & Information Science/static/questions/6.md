Are there any libraries that try to preserve old software or old computer games?
=====================
Or are a huge percent of old computer games never archived and ever
preserved?

* Ashley Nunn: This strikes me as just a giant list question, which isn't all that
constructive.
* Kris C: Could the question be reworded to not be a giant list question as the
sentiment seems reasonable and interesting. Off the top of my head: "How
do libraries approach the challenge of preservation of old software or
games, including which items are worth preserving? Are there any agreed
policies and standards in this area?"
* JakeParis: Yeah, but now we're going to keep the question just for jeff's great
answer!

The [Computer & Video Game
Archive](http://www.lib.umich.edu/computer-video-game-archive) is housed
at the University of Michigan's Art, Architecture and Engineering
Library.

> The archive "collects materials relating to games for the purpose of
> academic inquiry, including but not limited to:"
>
> -   programming and technology
> -   artistic and literary expression
> -   social and cultural impact
> -   instruction and education

They have over 2,500 titles listed in their [public
catalog](http://mirlyn-classic.lib.umich.edu/F/?func=find-a&find_code=WSU&request=%22video+games%22&request_op=OR&find_code=WTI&request=%22computer+games%22&request_op=OR&find_code=WAU&request=&filter_code_7=WTP&filter_code_1=WLN&filter_request_1=&filter_code_2=WYR&filter_request_2=&filter_code_4=WTP&filter_request_4=&filter_code_3=WYR&filter_request_3=&filter_code_5=WSL&filter_request_5=AAEL&filter_code_6=WCO&filter_request_6=GAME),
and visitors "can use and play a wide variety of games from the 1970s to
the present".

There is also the [National Reference Software Library
(NSRL)](http://www.nsrl.nist.gov) at the National Institute of Standards
& Technology (NIST). It is aimed at research into software as well as
the law enforcement community. The NSRL is made up of three components:
1. A large collection of software packages. 2. A database containing
detailed information, or metadata, about the files that make up those
software packages. 3. A public dataset, the NSRL Reference Data Set
(RDS) which contains a subset of the metadata held in the database for
each file in the collection. The RDS is published and updated every
three months.

Probably not as fun as the Computer & Video Game Archive, but useful in
other ways.

University of Calgary has one too --

UT-Austin's Video Game Archive is another resource:

Another resource to look at is the UIUC Gaming Initiative's Archive
page:

UC Santa Cruz also has a large collection of video games (over 600) and
consoles (over 40). There is also a video game lab. For more info, check
out their website:

[http://library.ucsc.edu/video-games](http://library.ucsc.edu/video-games)

If you're interested in games in the library, you might also be
interested in this recent Journal of Higher Ed article on games in the
library:

[http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/games-in-the-library/37667](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/games-in-the-library/37667)

The article mentions preservation issues (with preserving virtual
worlds, for instance) and also mentions the Games in Libraries podcast:

Stanford also has a rather impressive video game collection.
[http://speaking.stanford.edu/Back\_Issues/SOC71/library/Game\_Studies\_Resources.html](http://speaking.stanford.edu/Back_Issues/SOC71/library/Game_Studies_Resources.html)

There is also the International Center for the History of Electronic
Games [http://www.icheg.org/](http://www.icheg.org/)

If you are interested in more of the general theory and basic research
that is going on with video game preservation I would suggest reviewing
the work done as part of preserving virtual worlds
[http://pvw.illinois.edu/pvw/](http://pvw.illinois.edu/pvw/)

An interesting outcome of much of this work is that, in part because of
all the rights issues involved, many of the best examples of videogame
preservation are happening through fan run rom and emulator sites. For
exmaple, Home of the Underdogs
[http://www.hotud.org/](http://www.hotud.org/) or Virtual Apple 2
[http://www.virtualapple.org/](http://www.virtualapple.org/)

I believe the Computer History Museum in Mountain View is creating such
a collection:

The National Videogame Archive (UK) is collecting videogames, with
[details
here](http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk/Collection/NewMedia/NationalVideogameArchive.aspx).

A new collaborative initiative (that I'm involved in) is beginning to
build a collection of websites about gaming culture and experience. This
is a partnership between the British Library, the UK Web Archive and the
National Videogame Archive. This is operating on the basis that the
experience and impact of gaming (as captured by gamers and others) is
more important to preserve than the games themselves, and is likely to
be more informative for future users of the archive (for example, see
["(Not) Playing Games: Player-Produced Walkthroughs as Archival
Documents of Digital Gameplay", James
Newman](http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/186)).

A number of European national libraries are obligated to collect
videogames under digital legal deposit regulations, including (I
believe) Germany and Denmark.

The [Computerspielemuseum in Berlin has a substantial videogame
collection](http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/1210_Home.htm).

Despite growing efforts to preserve computer games, the preservation of
other software seems to be somewhat lacking. Other than the NSRL,
support seems to be stronger for sustaining current software as a
business process (eg. [SSI](http://www.software.ac.uk/), [TIMBUS
Project](http://timbusproject.net/)) rather than archiving obsolete
software.

A number of sites exist to capture information on old games and files
where possible. [Home of the UnderDogs](http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/)
being a notable one.

Their nature makes them a little less reliable than libraries, but
underdogs has been existence on 'community funds' for several years.
