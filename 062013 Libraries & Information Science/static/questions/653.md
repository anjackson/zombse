Bibliometric measures for research groups?
=====================
There are bibliometric measures for journals (most notoriously, impact
factor, but also Eigenfactor) and bibliometric measures for individuals
(such as h-index), but does anyone know of bibliometric measures aimed
at *group* impact, as for a lab or research center or department? Have
the alt-metrics folks come up with any?

* Joe: The closest that I can think of is that I remember someone had a poster
at ASIS&T a few years back tracking faculty advisors & advisees ... I
\*think\* it was [A Preliminary Social Network Analysis of
MPACT](http://www.asis.org/Conferences/AM07/posters/79.html), and
looking over the full text, the only bibliographic stuff they reference
is dissertations ... but one of their references is a [2005 Persson &
Åström paper on most cited
universities](http://www8.umu.se/inforsk/BibliometricNotes/BN2-2005/BN2-2005.h).

People have tried using h-index for groups, but somewhat unsuccessfully
IMO. Here's an example, I'll try to edit this later with more: van Raan,
A. (2006). Comparison of the hirsch-index with standard bibliometric
indicators and with peer judgment for 147 chemistry research groups.
Scientometrics, 67(3), 491. DOI: 10.1007/s11192-006-0066-4

* Simon Spero: I'm inclined to agree; H doesn't seem to have a natural fit for multiple
authors; what do you count as self-citation, how do you account for
changed composition over time; is the metric dominated by the top
articles of just a few group members, etc.
* Joe: odd... the doi wont resolve, but I found it referenced in multiple
places, but it wont resolve ...

Scientometrics is usually the first place to check; many of their
articles are open-access.\
 This article may be a good seed for reference following:

A answer more specific to the dsalo would be to ask Dietmar Wolfram at
UWM; he's been an active researcher in this field for a long time, and
may be able to recommend experts at YPOW.

Have a look at the following sites which have very detailed methodology
for ranking groups and institutions.

[http://kib.ki.se/sites/kib.ki.se/files/Bibliometric\_indicators\_definitions\_1.0.pdf](http://kib.ki.se/sites/kib.ki.se/files/Bibliometric_indicators_definitions_1.0.pdf)

[http://kib.ki.se/sites/kib.ki.se/files/bibliometric\_handbook\_karolinska\_institutet\_v\_1.05.pdf](http://kib.ki.se/sites/kib.ki.se/files/bibliometric_handbook_karolinska_institutet_v_1.05.pdf)

[http://www.leidenranking.com/methodology.aspx](http://www.leidenranking.com/methodology.aspx)

I am not an expert but my casual reading in the past 2 years in this
area seem to indicate among other groups CWTS, Leiden University has
done a lot of research on this area.
