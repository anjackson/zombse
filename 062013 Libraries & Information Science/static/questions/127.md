Are there any models for International material donation between libraries?
=====================
Developing countries typically have much smaller budgets for libraries
than developed nations.

For example, in India, government libraries are usually short-staffed,
and short on budget.

They could very well use older books and publications which the
libraries in the US or Europe (English language) would discard due to
age or lack of patronage.

Are there any such programs already? If so please list.

These would also work for Spanish/French too, to different third-world
countries.

* Joe: Not directly libraries helping libraries, but our Friends group gives to
[Books for International Goodwill](http://www.big-books.org/) who then
send it to libraries, schools, etc. But the problem is finding books in
the right language, with the correct local cultural norms. That's why
[Room to Read](http://www.roomtoread.org/) publishes their own books,
too.
* Peter Murray: Could you edit the title to be more representative of the question and
answers? This is more about material donation specifically than about
cooperation generally.

[Better World Books](http://www.betterworldbooks.com/) and their partner
[Books for Africa](http://www.booksforafrica.org/) may be the sort of
organization you are looking for. See also [Read
International](http://readinternational.org.uk/) in the UK.

If you are looking for information beyond just books, there is Libraries
Without Borders, an international collaboration to help small libraries
learn from larger ones. They also have a book resource program.

oh i'm very interested in this question. i live in bolivia where there's
no public library system like exists in the u.s. we're looking to set up
a small library in a town just outside of la paz, the capitol, and i
can't help but think of all the practically-new spanish-english books
that my old library system in the u.s. used to weed on a regular basis
due to space issues.

i believe the org. mentioned by @jdscott50 has recently helped set up a
small library in guatemala.. i would love to know where they got their
books.

* Joe: You might not be able to furnish a typical library, but some of the
[tiny
libraries](http://www.wired.com/geekmom/2011/11/creating-tiny-libraries-everywhere/)
might serve some of the needs, and get people interested in organizing
to find how to get funding for what we think of as a 'normal library'.
* andrea: thanks for the link and yes, we're thinking along the lines of a kisok
to start with and then look at how the community uses it and move on to
fundraising from there, with more concrete goals in mind.

I think you have to make a distinction between books that are no longer
needed because they are out of date, as opposed to books that are still
of interest to readers.

Most academic libraries usually retain previous editions for some time,
as these still have relevant information. There is no point in shipping
non-useful books to India, if people in India aren't going to find them
useful either. That said, there are libraries that are weeding useful
materials, so it is worth making sure that any donations are clearly
defined so that time and money is not wasted.

We're in the middle of arranging a donation of older, but still useful,
books to a similiar organisation in Africa. The costs of shipping aren't
too bad, but it does take a lot of organising to get this done. Smaller
exchanges of materials would be easier, and ofcourse, the smaller the
mass/volume, the smaller the costs. We're using a shipping container,
which allows us to load easily, but are filling this with cardboard
boxes-- so we can fit more in and don't have to worry about getting
pallets.

These types of donations require support from the top, so that is where
the conversation usually has to begin (or be escalated to). Any sort of
international conference has usually been our starting point; we gained
some exchange agreements via IFLA, and this donation idea was begun at a
Pacific conference.

Individual approaches work better than sending generic letters to
organisations. Network widely, and recognise that for every 10-20
conversations you may have, only 1 might lead to something. Use a
reputable firm for the logistics, and see if you can get a sponsorship
to cover the costs of the shipping.

Good luck.
