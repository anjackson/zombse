=====================
How to build a moviesongs database similar to IMDB for commercial use

* Melissa: This question could be answered in many different ways -- perhaps too
close to an opinion question. Are you looking for software or Web sites
to create a database? Are you looking for the movie information?
* Ashley Nunn: This isn't something we really deal with here - this isn't really a
libraries and information science question, especially not as it stands
now. Unfortunately, I am going to have to close it as off topic. For
more ideas of the sorts of things we do deal with here, please see our
[FAQ].
