What is Japan's equivalent of the National Archives and Records Administration?
=====================
In the USA, the [National Archives and Records
Administration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration)
(NARA) is an independent agency of the government, charged with
preserving government and historical records.

In Japan, is there a similar agency?

You're probably looking for the [National Archives of
Japan](http://www.archives.go.jp/english/index.html).

Agreed. Though you may also find useful materials at the National Diet
Library (http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/index.html) which is the equivalent to
the US Library of Congress.
