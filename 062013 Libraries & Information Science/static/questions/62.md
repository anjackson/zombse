These systems are known as "classification systems." Dewey Decimal
Classification is most often found in public libraries. Some smaller
public libraries have elected to use [BISAC, a classification system
designed for
bookstores](http://www.bisg.org/publications/product.php?p=14) instead;
see [this article](http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6698264.html)
for more information and example libraries.

Academic libraries typically use the much more detailed [Library of
Congress Classification](http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/). Medical
libraries often use [NLM
Classification](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/nlmclassif.html).

Old-school librarians talk in hushed voices of Ranganathan's [Colon
Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_classification), a
very early faceted-classification system. No one today actually uses it
that I'm aware, but the general faceting approach can be seen in many
library catalogs today -- look for limit options in sidebars!

A main alternative to the Dewey Decimal system (especially in English
speaking countries) is the [Library of Congress classification
system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification).
It is commonly used in research and academic libraries.

As the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcc.html)
website explains:

> The system divides all knowledge into twenty-one basic classes, each
> identified by a single letter of the alphabet. Most of these
> alphabetical classes are further divided into more specific
> subclasses, identified by two-letter, or occasionally three-letter,
> combinations. For example, class N, Art, has subclasses NA,
> Architecture; NB, Sculpture, ND, Painting; as well as several other
> subclasses. Each subclass includes a loosely hierarchical arrangement
> of the topics pertinent to the subclass, going from the general to the
> more specific. Individual topics are often broken down by specific
> places, time periods, or bibliographic forms (such as periodicals,
> biographies, etc.). Each topic (often referred to as a caption) is
> assigned a single number or a span of numbers. Whole numbers used in
> LCC may range from one to four digits in length, and may be further
> extended by the use of decimal numbers. Some subtopics appear in
> alphabetical, rather than hierarchical, lists and are represented by
> decimal numbers that combine a letter of the alphabet with a numeral ,
> e.g. .B72 or .K535. Relationships among topics in LCC are shown not by
> the numbers that are assigned to them, but by indenting subtopics
> under the larger topics that they are a part of, much like an outline.

There is also the [NLM
classification](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/nlmclassif.html)
that is used more often in medical libraries.

> The NLM Classification covers the field of medicine and related
> sciences. The scheme is a system of classification intended to be used
> for the shelf arrangement of all library materials, regardless of
> format. Designed as a broad classification, it is suitable for both
> large and small library collections and may be adapted to handle
> specialized collections of any size.
>
> The NLM Classification is a system of mixed notation patterned after
> the Library of Congress (LC) Classification where alphabetical letters
> which denote broad subject categories are further subdivided by
> numbers. The NLM Classification utilizes schedules QS-QZ and W-WZ,
> permanently excluded from the LC Classification Schedules and is
> intended to be used with the LC schedules which supplement the NLM
> Classification for subjects bordering on medicine and for general
> reference materials. The LC schedules for Human Anatomy (QM),
> Microbiology (QR), and Medicine (R) are not used at all by the
> National Library of Medicine since they overlap the NLM
> Classification.

There is also the [BISAC
system](http://www.bisg.org/activities-programs/activity.php?n=d&id=73&cid=20),
which is used mainly for booksellers, but also has been adapted for
library use.

> The BISAC Subject Headings List, also known as the BISAC Subject Codes
> List, is a standard used by many companies throughout the supply chain
> to categorize books based on topical content. The Subject Heading
> applied to a book can determine where the work is shelved in a brick
> and mortar store or the genre(s) under which it can be searched for in
> an internal database.

Another option is the [Universal Decimal
Classification](http://www.udcc.org/about.htm) system.

> The Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is the world's foremost
> multilingual classification scheme for all fields of knowledge, a
> sophisticated indexing and retrieval tool. It was adapted by Paul
> Otlet (Rayward's Otlet page; Wikipedia entry ) and Nobel Prizewinner
> Henri La Fontaine from the Decimal Classification of Melvil Dewey, and
> first published (in French) between 1904 and 1907. Since then, it has
> been extensively revised and developed, and has become a highly
> flexible and effective system for organizing bibliographic records for
> all kinds of information in any medium (it is well suited to
> multi-media information collections). It is structured in such a way
> that new developments and new fields of knowledge can be readily
> incorporated. The code itself is independent of any particular
> language or script (consisting of arabic numerals and common
> punctuation marks), and the accompanying class descriptions have
> appeared in many translated versions. UDC is in worldwide use, and has
> been published in whole or in part in 40 different languages.

There are also various classification systems in other languages, such
as [Chinese Library
Classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Library_Classification),
and the Russian [BBK
Classification](http://www.indiana.edu/~libslav/slavcatman/bbkover.html)
System.

The [English Wikipedia article on library
classifications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_classification#Types)
lists some examples but the overview is not very practical. I
contributed [to the German
article](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliotheksklassifikation), which
lists the classification schemes most used in German libraries. The
systems are divided between public libraries and academic libraries, I
don't know whether this is also common in other languages. Several large
university libraries, manage their own classifications, at least in
Germany. These custom schemes often derive from each other, but
unfortunately there is no revision control system.

What we are using at my library is that books are still coded with Dewey
(I think), but the books are arranged in something called the GLADES.
This means the non-fiction collection is sorted by broad topics like
Play, Life (biographies), Travel and Home. Then in Home, the collection
is broken in these large sections like cooking books. Then when you go
look in the cooking section, the books are arranged by their Dewey call
number.
