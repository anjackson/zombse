Software for Folksonomies
=====================
What open-source software exist to enable communities to develop
folksonomies based on the effectiveness of a given community member's
performance relative to the greater community?

For example of performance in taxonomy skills include indexing, semantic
fitness, deduplication, synonym assignment, etc.

By greater community, I mean how a user performance in rates against
other users of the system that actively create, edit, and/or delete
tags.

<ul class="tags"><li class="tag">software</li></ul>

* Trevor Owens: This question is a bit unclear. What do you mean by a given community
member's performance? Do you mean their accuracy in relation to
identifying the same tags? Also, what do you mean by the greater
community, do you mean other users of the system?
* blunders: @TrevorOwens: Updated the body of the question. If you have any
additional questions, let me know. Thanks!

I don't think there are anythings out there that are nearly this
sophisticated. The two open source projects I know about are STEVE and
the Metadata Games.

[Steve](http://tagger.steve.museum/) is a open source tool that pools
tagging into a larger community.

[Metadata Games](http://www.tiltfactor.org/metadata-games) are a few
simple open source tools for doing google image labler like games.

* blunders: +1 @Trevor Owens: Ah, guess I was thinking more along the line of
textual taxonomies development. I was unable to quickly find a demo of
Steve's curation system, but the public taxonomy to me seem adhoc;
though it's very possible I looked at a poor sampling of the sum of it's
network. The Google Image Labeler mechanics were pretty solid, though I
was able to find a [Metadata Games
demo](http://metadatagames.dartmouth.edu) and
[license](http://metadatagames.dartmouth.edu/mg/LICENSE), I was unable
to find the source-code, etc for Metadata Games.

A folksonomy is not created or managed alone but always connected with a
collection, so you might be looking for a **social tagging system**. For
instance BibSonomy is Open Source:
[http://dev.bibsonomy.org/](http://dev.bibsonomy.org/). As the term
"folksonomy" is used very fuzzy, you should first use the typology of
tagging systems from [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.IR/0701072)
and decide **what kind of system** you are looking for. The most
important dimension is tag aggregation (set-model or bag model). You
might also be looking for a system for managing controlled vocabularies
(subject indexes, thesauri, classifications..) by groups of people, but
I would not call this folksonomy, as the direct connection to tagged
resources is missing.
