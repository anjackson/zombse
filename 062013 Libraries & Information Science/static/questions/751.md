There's very little difference. Fair dealing only applies when use of a
work for specific purposes does not infringe copyright if the use is
only for criticism, parody, news reporting or research; and does not
affect the commercial value of the work. If a reproduction of work is
used, it is limited to 10% or a single chapter (dependant upon length).

The reference to fair use appears to be the same thing, although there
is no reference to parody or satire. [US Copyright Fair

* Fisher: From your source: "The 1961 Report of the Register of Copyrights on the
General Revision of the U.S. Copyright Law cites examples of activities
that courts have regarded as fair use: â€œ[. . .] use in a parody of some
of the content of the work parodied; summary of an address or article"
* Deborah Mould: Yes in the report, but not in the the Act itself.
