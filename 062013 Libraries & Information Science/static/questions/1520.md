Archival Intelligence and the term "collection number"
=====================
We are revising our archival finding aids to be more
archival-intelligence friendly (more plain language, less jargon) and
are trying to find alternative for the term "collection number" or
"unique identifier." What terms do you use/suggest using?

Anything you pick will seem like jargon to somebody else until they
learn the distinctions. Choosing words out of a thesaurus as if similar
means equal, is like saying that all ice cream flavors taste like ice
cream.
