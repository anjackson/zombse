What types of publication dates exist?
=====================
I want to generate a statistic of number of publications by year from a
set of bibliographic records (internal PICA+ format, but I could convert
for instance to MARC2 or MODS). Surprisingly several publications have
not a simple publication year but an additional "original date" or
uncertain dates or range of years etc. Is there an overview of most
common types of publication dates and how they are encoded in
bibliographic records?

Take a look at ONIX code lists:

[http://www.editeur.org/ONIX/book/codelists/current.html](http://www.editeur.org/ONIX/book/codelists/current.html)

...especially List 163, Publishing date role and some of the other "date
role" lists for an overview of what the publishing industry considers
important to describe...
