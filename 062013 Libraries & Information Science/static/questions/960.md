How to create/manage access to digitised/born digital personal archives on PCs in reading rooms?
=====================
In my library we have both digitised and born digital archival material.
We want to make both available to readers via PCs.

Readers will need to belong to the library and have signed a readers
undertaking before access can be granted. So access will have to be via
a login dialogue box. We also need to restrict access to this material
by disabling print, save, USB ports and CD-drives. PCs can't be
dedicated to digital archival material and for access to other
materials/the web save, USB ports and CD-drives must be enabled.

What is the optimal method for setting up such viewing stations?

One model you might want to consider is using that of the [NORC Data
Enclave](http://www.dataenclave.org/index.php/home), which uses locked
down thin-client sessions (IIRC, they're using Citrix). There was a
relatively [recent article in the International Journal of Digital
Curation](http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/31/34) on the
Data Enclave.
