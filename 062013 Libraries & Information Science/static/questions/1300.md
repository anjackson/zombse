Excel-only toolkit for creating XML data?
=====================
I'd like to use Excel to programmatically create XML data files to
several known XSD schemas; or more specifically, a small profile of each
schema.

Are there any sets of macros/procedural ways of using functions & Excel
add-ins you know of that can (help me to) do this?

Excel provides some functionality for importing schema, mapping XML
elements to spreadsheet columns, and exporting XML. See this [MS Office
page](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/overview-of-xml-in-excel-HA010206396.aspx?CTT=3)
for more details and setup instructions.

You have a couple options for applying the XSD to your data inside
Excel. If you are comfortable editing your XSD file, you could name your
column headers inside and have them automatically merge when you import
the XSD.

Alternatively, you could add your XSD as an "XML Map", drag it to a
workbook, and reorganize your data as necessary.

If you want to do it the VBA way, check out the `XMLMaps` and
`SaveAsXMLData` methods on `ActiveWorkbook` (e.g.
[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff196723.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff196723.aspx)).

This topic is pretty well-covered on StackOverflow; see

related questions.
