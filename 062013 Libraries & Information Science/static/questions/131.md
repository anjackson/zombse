Scripting test cases in Aleph
=====================
During evaluation of new software releases, I often find myself punching
in test cases for hours. The
[Aleph](http://www.exlibris.co.il/category/Aleph) Circulation GUI, while
an easy access for librarians at the booking desk, doesn't really
support repetitive tasks, and so I'd like to delegate at least the less
creative ones to a script on the server.

Is it possible to add fees like 100 fees of 1ct to a test user by script
while maintaining the integrity of logfiles? I know that I could just
add those fees by means of SQL, but that wouldn't go through the booking
procedure, and might not produce valid test cases.

How are other libraries handling these tasks?

Aleph has an API that they call X-Services, with [a documentation and
user-scripts
website](http://www.exlibrisgroup.org/display/CodeShare/Home). With any
luck at all, there will be a fee-and-fine hook in there somewhere. Good
luck!

* Tatjana Heuser: Thanks, this sounds like the route to go. I'll check and report.
* Tatjana Heuser: I've found a [bit of documentation](http://documents.el-una.org/99/),
and it looks like I cannot use this, since it seems to require a
separate Web Server to be started by Aleph.
