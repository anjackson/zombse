What is the best format/standard for archiving static web pages? What software generates that format?
=====================
Assuming a static website (or a dynamic website that I'm choosing to
archive as a static site), what is the best file format or standard to
use to capture all of the dependencies (embedded images, CSS,
JavaScript, iframes, etc.) and http metadata (last modified headers,
content type, etc.). Ideally, I'd like a file format with an open
specification and multiple implementations for reading the file.

The problem is that most of the 'solutions' are browser specific, and
they're not really intended for archiving:

-   Apple's [WebArchive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webarchive)
-   Microsoft's [MHTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML)
-   Mozilla extension
    [MAFF](http://maf.mozdev.org/maff-specification.html)
-   Chrome extension
    [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile)

MHTML is based on [RFC 2557](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2557.html)
(MIME encapsulation of multiple documents), and SingleFile is based on
re-writing other elements as `data:` URIs per [RFC
2397](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2397.txt)

MHTML likely has the widest support for reading, but if I were to do it,
I'd personally be inclined to grab the whole site (rather than a single
page) and re-write it using similar logic as
[`wget --convert-links`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Recursive-Retrieval-Options),
then pack the whole thing using [Bag
It](https://wiki.ucop.edu/display/Curation/BagIt) w/ appropriate
metadata (HTTP headers & checksums).

(and my definition of 'site' isn't necessary 'all web pages on a given
server' ... it's more those that share the same images/javascript/css
and are highly inter-linked)

... and for reference, the Internet Archive uses a file format they call
[ARC](http://archive.org/web/researcher/ArcFileFormat.php) ([more
legible alternative, if you bump the font size
up](http://web.archive.org/web/20080702190415/http://pages.alexa.com/company/arcformat.html)),
based on 100MB groups of files. The [Web Curator
Tool](http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/) also uses ARC.

### Comments ###
* Andy Jackson: Note that the Internet Archive use WARC instead of ARC these days and
the Web Curator Tool supports both the ARC and WARC formats.

I believe you're looking for ISO 28500:2009, aka WARC, the Web ARChive
file format.

-- ISO 28500:2009, final draft

Software
--------

The development version of wget can output to WARC.

There is a [sponsored project to leverage support for the WARC archiving
format in JHOVE2 and
NetarchiveSuite](https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/JhoNAS+project+-+WARC+support+in+JHOVE2+and+NetarchiveSuite)

The Internet Archive has many of their tools published on Github:

-   "[Heritrix](https://github.com/internetarchive/heritrix3), the
    Internet Archive web crawler
-   "[draintasker](https://github.com/internetarchive/draintasker)",
    which is used to pull data in WARC format from a crawler and
    transmit it to longer term storage.
-   "[warc](https://github.com/internetarchive/warc)", a Python library
    for reading and writing WARC files
-   "[wayback](https://github.com/internetarchive/wayback)", the
    infamous Wayback Machine, a de-facto WARC "viewer"

[warc-tools](http://code.hanzoarchives.com/warc-tools) is a Python-based
suite of tools for working with WARC files, though not technically a
"viewer".

Additional Reading
------------------

Archive Team has a writeup of [wget with WARC
output](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Wget_with_WARC_output),
including links to [the final draft of ISO
28500:2009](http://bibnum.bnf.fr/WARC/WARC_ISO_28500_version1_latestdraft.pdf)
and [implementation guidelines from the WARC usage task
force](http://netpreserve.org/publications/WARC_Guidelines_v1.pdf).

The United States Library of Congress has [some analysis of the WARC
format](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000236.shtml)
with respect to its suitability as a sustainable digital format.

* dsalo: heh. beat me to it. :)
* Ed Summers: beat me too :-)
* dsalo: Is there a viewer for WARC besides wayback? Seems like that would be a
useful thing; when I've archived websites (via DSpace), they've wanted
dissemination as well.
* Peter Murray: Thanks @jeff; this is the sort of thing I'm looking for. I'm also
interested in @dsalo's question about other viewers from the perspective
of unpacking at the server level and sending the components back to the
browser.
