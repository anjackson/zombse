=====================
electronic resources - "Material (data and/or program(s)) encoded for
manipulation by a computerized device. This material may require the use
of a peripheral directly connected to a computerized device (e.g.,
CD-ROM drive) or a connection to a computer network (e.g., the
Internet)." This definition does not include electronic resources that
do not require the use of a computer, for example, music compact discs
and videodiscs."
