Are there functional standards or operational frameworks for managing physical collections similar to the OAIS for digital collections? ISO standards?
=====================
I know there are accreditation processes for cultural heritage
organizations, but I'm not really interested in that component. What I
would like to do is to understand what are the shared or baseline
functional competencies of physical collections management; and I am
particularly curious if there is a **codified** standard theoretic
framework for a library and/or archive.

It kind of sounds like a silly question to me because of course there is
an entire discipline of standards and best practices out there for
library operation; but, I guess I'm just curious if there are comparable
frameworks for physical collections as there are for digital
collections.

This question was actually sparked by looking at the NDSA "Levels of
Preservation" but I figure more people are familiar with OAIS?

Is this a silly question?

Look up BSI committee IDT/2 for a list of International and British
Standards, and their current work:

[http://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/Home/Committee/50001768](http://standardsdevelopment.bsigroup.com/Home/Committee/50001768)

An example standard is (BS) ISO 11799 Information and documentation -
Document storage requirements for archive and library materials
