Setting up eBooks lending programs at a local public library
=====================
My local library, in a small town, currently does not offer eBooks. When
I asked them if they have plans to support offering books
electronically, they said they have no clue how to go about getting set
up for something like that. Are there some steps involved or a site I
can direct them to help get them set up on an eBook program?

* Joe: When our local library started offering ebooks through OverDrive, they
ended up becoming the tech support for Kindle, it seemed. Don't forget
to consider this issue/cost. (and the annoying things, like how you
can't use a pre-paid credit card to activate a Kindle ... it has to be
linked to a real credit card, as best I can tell)
* JakeParis: @Joe, we experience the same thing (about the tech support), but we're
attempting to take it in stride and become a more service-oriented
institution.
* KatieR: The public library I work at offers ebooks through OverDrive. I often
find myself warning patrons that certain titles might not be available
on OverDrive and that is not our fault but rather OverDrive and their
agreements with publishers. It is rather frustrating to not have certain
publishers present on the application.
* foggyone: It does raise some big expectations. I've had people who think
everything in the library is now available online!

lists several vendors who will be very happy to talk to your library
staff about e-books:

-   [Baker & Taylor](http://www.baker-taylor.com/axis360/)
-   [Freading](http://freading.com/index)
-   [OverDrive](http://www.overdrive.com/)
-   [3M Cloud

* JakeParis: Just to note: Overdrive & 3M are priced in the tens of thousands.
Freading is manageable in terms of price, but does not boast a good
selection of publishers. Baker & Taylor's Axis360 is one of the more
promising systems in terms of usability, but does not currently support
Kindle format.
* foggyone: We've come across the Kindle problem, too. So many people use them that
to dive into a system that doesn't support them isn't practical.
* Ben Ostrowsky: And since Kindle has apps for iOS and Android, supporting that format
would be helpful for more than just Kindle hardware.

If it's a really small library, they may not be able to afford it.
[Public Libraries Jan/Feb
2012](http://www.publiclibrariesonline.org/magazines/issues/janfeb-2012)
issue addresses getting into the ebook game.

EDIT: They might be able to work with a larger group (county, area,
state consortia) to help them, as well.

Assuming they are a small library with very limited funds (and no
available consortia), I would suggest they start by working with eBooks
which are in the public domain. If they are able to set up a system to
get these materials to their members, that would be a boon to the
community, even if the materials are not Best-Sellers. Check out
[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), a online resource with
over 39,000 non-copyrighted items.

That being said, for a small or medium-size library with no experience
managing their own digital content delivery system, I would suggest that
the best course of action is for the staff to become extremely
knowledgeable about getting eBooks from third-party sources
([Amazon](http://amazon.com/), [Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org),
[Blio](http://blio.com)) and onto their members' own eReaders. This
knowledge can end up being the only thing that is required to help
members get what they need.

For free, right now, you can add some Project Gutenberg titles to your
catalog. The Colorado Library Consortium has 300+ cleaned up MARC
records for the most popular Gutenberg titles that can be loaded in the
catalog right now.

Internet Archive also has a program that allows local libraries to
access its 20th century digitized collection, such that patrons who come
into the library can actually "borrow" one of these digitized texts onto
their device and then read at home. See

You may be interested in WebJunction's list of ideas for getting to know
readers and ebooks:

[http://www.webjunction.org/content/webjunction/explore-topics/mobile-devices.html](http://www.webjunction.org/content/webjunction/explore-topics/mobile-devices.html)

I know that touching the readers, seeing how they work, how they feel,
etc. is really essential, too. If possible, you may be able to do this
at your local mall - if there is an Apple Store, you can check out the
iPod Touch, iPad and iPhone. If you have Barnes & Noble nearby, you can
get Nook info. Target, Best Buy, etc. have Android based readers.
Online, Amazon's Kindle information is extensive.

The other side is the need for vendor information. Overdrive is huge and
is the only one that is Kindle friendly, which means it can communicate
with your OPAC for your patrons to be able to link to their library
account. Overdrive is at: [http://overdrive.com](http://overdrive.com)

An Overdrive salesperson will probably be more than happy to talk to
your library if you are thinking about moving into ebooks.

As the others mentioned, having free options such as trying these out
through Project Gutenberg certainly helps you get an idea. If you or
someone you know has an Amazon account, and a Kindle, and can show you
how it works that way, it's pretty cool to see.

One final thought is to check out other libraries' sites. For example,
the Delaware Division of Libraries offers helpful info through their
ebooks area:
