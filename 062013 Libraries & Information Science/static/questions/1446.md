Public domain ISSN list?
=====================
1.  Is there a list of ISSNs (that is a minimum association of an ISSN
    with a journal title) that is in the public domain?

2.  If there is no such list and someone would aggregate such a list by
    using a variety of freely available sources, such as library
    catalogs and publisher websites, would it be illegal to put such a
    list into the public domain?

* jonsca: I don't think we can really touch on the issue of legality here, as we'd
have to determine what the legal standards are, and those are obviously
not universal. Honestly, I would prefer if you would rework this a bit
to make it more general than just "is there a list", if you could.
* miku: Sorry for the late reply. Yes, there is no universal legal framework -
so at least my second question is very vague (I just wanted to see, if
there are any possible immediate objection, that might come up).

I have created [an aggregated list using a few different
sources](https://github.com/hubgit/journal-names), but have not added a
license to the data, as its status is unclear. I would like the ISSN
International Centre to release this data themselves, under an open data
license.
