Where can I get info on the status of FRBR?
=====================
The [FRBR blog](http://www.frbr.org/) hasn't had any updates in more
than a year. Are there any other sites aggregating information about the
current status on FRBR, particularly on the status of how to handle
aggregate works?

The best place to look and to ask at is the [FRBR mailing
list](http://infoserv.inist.fr/wwsympa.fcgi/info/frbr). Depending on
your needs I would also recommend other mailing lists, conferences and
journals, such as [Code4Lib](http://www.code4lib.org/).

The FRBR mailing list is unfortunately stagnant - there hasn't been any
substantive traffic there in over a year. Major FRBR related news is
posted by IFLA at
[http://www.ifla.org/en/cataloguing](http://www.ifla.org/en/cataloguing),
and these announcements frequently find their way to cataloging
listservs like Autocat (http://listserv.syr.edu/archives/autocat.html)
and RDA-L (http://www.rda-jsc.org/rdadiscuss.html), which frequently
have participant discussion about FRBR, though much of it is
ill-informed. There's also small amounts of info on the FRBR Review
Group's page at
[http://www.ifla.org/about-the-frbr-review-group](http://www.ifla.org/about-the-frbr-review-group).
But overall FRBR news is VERY hard to come by these days. I understand
there are some harmonization efforts underway to bring together the
three FR-models, but don't know for sure where that's been announced or
if there's a full description of the activity anywhere.

Regarding your specific question about aggregates in FRBR, the working
group on that topic concluded and issued its final report in 2011:

* Joe: Thanks ... that's what I was afraid of ... now I'm actually going to
have to see if I can squeeze in the time to write up [my thoughts on
'collections' in
FRBR](http://vso1.nascom.nasa.gov/vso/misc/FRBR-aggregates-code4lib.ppt)
(warning, 16MB PPT file) before the ASIS&T poster/short paper deadline.

As the owner of the FRBR Blog, I apologize for letting it go dormant.
Reading this was a good reminder that I need to fix that, so I'm now
looking for some one or some group to take over frbr.org. If anyone is
reading this and has an idea for it, please get in touch.
