How is a storytime aimed at toddlers different from other age groups?
=====================
How would a storytime that is aimed at toddlers (ages 1 to 3 or 4) be
different from a storytime for babies or kindergarten aged kids?

Story time for toddlers generally has more songs and finger play along
with some activities that allow for the toddlers to move around. At that
stage it is important to realize that toddlers need to move around in
addition to a story. By kindergarten it is reasonable to expect the
children to sit still for a bit longer and participate in some
discussion (question and answer) regarding the story.

Also, select books that have very short text and large, bright pictures
-- detailed illustrations are hard to see at any age storytime, but
especially for toddlers.

If you have crafts, they need to be pretty simple with only a few parts
or steps. The parts themselves can't be too small either.

I've found that the Toddler Age group (2 to 3) responds really well to
flannel boards and even better if everyone could participate in some
aspect of the telling.

Allow plenty of opportunities for group participation, but don't expect
a child to actively participate if they do not want to. For a toddler,
just watching may be their form of participation.
