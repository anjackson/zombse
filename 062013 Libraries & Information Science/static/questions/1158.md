Online magazine delivery
=====================
Our public library is considering moving to
[Zinio](http://www.zinio.com/magazines/?csid=cj) for online delivery of
some of our magazines. Apparently we would pay money for the platform,
then a flat fee for each subscription, which can be then auto-delivered
to as many members as request it on the day it comes out. The magazines
are delivered in whole, including ads which help make the business model
affordable/profitable.

If your library has Zinio or another magazine delivery system:

-   are people using it?
-   is feedback positive?
-   did you run into technical issues getting it set up for user log-in?
-   has this affected your paper magazine usage or are you finding you
    have to carry both?
