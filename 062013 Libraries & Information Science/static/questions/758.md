What is an effective way to dry out a book that has gotten wet?
=====================
What is an effective way to dry out a book that has gotten wet? What if
a large number of books have gotten wet (e.g., after an accidental
sprinkler discharge)?

This assumes, of course, that the books appear to still be in reasonably
sound condition otherwise.

[Freeze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-drying) it. Large libraries
have contracts with refrigerated warehouses in their disaster plan. See
[this
report](http://ncptt.nps.gov/comparing-mass-drying-and-sterilization-protocols-for-water-damaged-books-2008-04/)
and other NCPTT publications for technical details and as starting point
to find more references. I am not familiar with English library science
textbooks but I guess there is also teaching material on freeze drying
books and library disaster planing in general.

* Joe: And even if you don't have the full freeze-drying rig, I've been told by
one of the archivists at my place of work that it's useful preservation
to keep mold or other nastiness from growing in there (even after you
think it's dry).
