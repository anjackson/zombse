METS serialization with Digital Object versioning
=====================
I'm looking for a solution to get a version identifier in a METS
representation of a Digital Object. I could not find anything related to
versioning in the [METS
schema](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/mets-schemadocs.html).

Naively i thought something like this would be possible:

    <mets:mets xmlns:mets="http://www.loc.gov/METS/" 
         OBJID="some-id-xxx" 
         VERSIONID="version-xxx" 
         LABEL="some-label">
          ...
    </mets:mets>

But there is no such thing as *VERSIONID* in the METS specs

Is there a general way to do this? Does a new Version always require to
be created with a distinct *OBJID* and a reference to the former Version
in the *Source metadata*?

### Comments ###
* anarchivist: Are you trying to indicate a version of the METS representation or of
the object itself?
* fas: the identifier should be for the object itself.
* Jakob: Has your question been answered (so you should mark an answer as
accepted) or do you have additional questions or comments? What's your
solution?
* fas: still working on a solution.


Answer by Jakob
----------------
One could embed the version in the [descriptive
metadata](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/METSOverview.v2.html#descMD)
or in the [administrative
metadata](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/METSOverview.v2.html#admMD)
in another metadata format, such as Dublin Core or MODS. I'd treat a
version identifier equal to an edition identifier. For instance in MODS
there is an `edition` child element of `originInfo`.

### Comments ###
* fas: the problem i have is that we are exclusively using DC for the
descriptive/source metadata set in our backend, and i can't find
anything usable as a Version Identifier in there:
http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml
* Jakob: Yes, there is no specific \*edition\* or \*version\* field in DC. The
property would surely be related to dc:identifier, so you should use
this property, similar to
[bibo:edition](http://bibotools.googlecode.com/svn/bibo-ontology/trunk/doc/index.html)
in the Bibliographic Ontology. For example \`dc:identifier = "version
1.3"\`.

Answer by Ed Summers
----------------
The METS documentation [talks
about](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/METSOverview.v2.html#filegrp)
using `mets:fileGrp` to record versions of a particular object: for
example an object that is available as a TEI transcript, an MP3 and a
WAV. These could be linked together in time by their `created`
attribute. But I get the sense that you are talking about versioning in
a different way, similar to how it is talked about in revision control
systems? The answer to Mark's question is important. Do you want to
version the metadata about the object, or the objects themselves? If the
latter I think you can probably bend mets:fileGrp to your will. If the
former, perhaps you need a new METS document that is linked somehow to
the previous one, via the identifier? If there isn't anything in METS it
might be a good use case for [RFC
5829](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5829).

### Comments ###
* Jakob: Looks like we have at least three possible notions of versions: revised
object versions, different representations of the same object, and
different descriptions of exactely the same object.
* fas: Yes i was talking about an Identifier which encompasses the whole
digital object. The idea is to create a new version every time some
property of the object has changed. So if someone were to update
technical metadata of a file contained in the object a new version of
the object is created referencing the changed metadata while the
original object stays the same.
