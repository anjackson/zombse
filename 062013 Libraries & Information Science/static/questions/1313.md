Information literacy instruction classes without course credit - are badges the answer?
=====================
I'm looking for examples of successful library instruction programs that
are not offering course credit. Have any institutions created a
multi-session program that students attend without earning credit? I
would like to offer digital badges to students upon the completion of 3
courses.

Yes, I do think that badges are an answer to this challenge. See the
notes to my presentation on this topic: [Changing the

* walker: Can you summarize some of the paper's content, examples, or findings
here in your answer?
* Mary Jo Finch: Interesting paper - I agree with your lamentations on grade inflation. I
can definitely see how it might be motivating to students to earn badges
in Using Databases, Navigating the Catalog, Citing Resources, etc. -
just like scouts!
