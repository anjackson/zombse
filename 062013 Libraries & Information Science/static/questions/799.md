How to encode fake "found text" metadata in TEI P5?
=====================
A "found text" (for this purpose) is one in which the publisher is
printing something not written for publication—at least, not in the
present manner—but rather a text or set of texts written in some other
context and now re-purposed by the publisher or editor. It has, at
times, been a common literary device to present an original work as a
"found text" with the author as "editor." Unfortunately, this presents
multiple sets of metadata, at least one of which contains deliberate
falsehoods which are, neveless, part of the storytelling and therefore
have value. So:

In TEI P5—we're at P5 version 2.1.0 as I ask this, but the high-level
structure should be the same throughout P5, so hopefully the answer is
general to P5—how might this false level of metadata be encoded without
entangling it with the true metadata?

Please keep in mind that such false metadata might be:

1.  implied only (e.g., *The Hobbit* as a book written by Bilbo
    Baggins),
2.  explicit, but kept to obviousin character" sections of the book
    while full true metadata is potentially available elsewhere (e.g.,
    real title page and copyright page followed by fake title page &c.),
    or
3.  not only presented as true but the only metadata presented on the
    physical item itself, the truth only being apparent elsewhere (e.g.,
    news reports, research, later editions).

I would be tempted to play around with the [Simple Analysis
Module](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/AI.html).
Creating an \<interp\> element to explain the "hoax," and then using
@ana to link to it anywhere the hoaxy (meta)data appears seems like it
should work.
