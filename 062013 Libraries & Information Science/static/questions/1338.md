Identifying if something might have fallen out of copyright
=====================
Our (newly formed) town historical society had someone bring by a
yearbook from 1946, so there's a good possibility that it fell out of
copyright in that period when authors had to register to extend their
copyright.

As there's no copyright notice on it, I assume that it falls within the
public domain per the rules given by [Cornell's "Copyright Term and the
Public Domain in the United
States"](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm)

Should we receive something from 1978 or after, or between 1923 and 1963
that has a copyright notice on it, what are the proper procedures that
an archive needs to perform to as due dilligance to determine if the
copyright was registered or extended, so that we can determine if it has
fallen into the public domain (ie, if we can scan it without them
gifting the item to us)?

I'm not sure about the best process for ensuring due diligence, but an
invaluable reference is the [Digital Copyright
Slider](http://librarycopyright.net/resources/digitalslider/), published
by Michael Brewer and the ALA Office of Information Technology Policy.
