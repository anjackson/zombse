How much damage do silverfish do to library books? 
=====================
I once opened the pages of an old copy of Richard Dawkins' "The Extended
Phenotype" in a library, and there was a dead silverfish in between the
pages of a book...

* Ashley Nunn: This is asking two questions at once, one of which is going to change
pretty rapidly and is pretty hard to keep track of - I would suggest
taking out the second question, and perhaps making the actual body of
the question a bit more detailed, with something other than the personal
anecdote.

[It really depends on how large the infestation is, and how long it has
been going
on](http://www.unesco.org/webworld/ramp/html/r8820e/r8820e05.htm).

They prefer moist, dark environments, so ensuring that they don't have
that kind of environment to thrive in will go a long way to ensuring the
safety of the books and other materials. [This
article](http://www.wvu.edu/~exten/infores/pubs/pest/hpm8002.pdf) speaks
mainly of silverfish in houses, not libraries, but the advice holds.

> Silverfish are usually introduced into houses from an outside source.
> Prevention of silverfish infestations should begin with sanitation.
> Vacuum cracks and crevices to remove dust and lint. Keep bookcases
> clean by vacuuming and shaking out books. Donâ€™t allow piles of old
> papers and magazines to accumulate. Check old bks before bringing them
> into the house. Store starched linens in sealed plastic bags. Seal
> cracks and crevices with caulking compound to reduce the number of
> hiding places. Make the environment less attractive by reducing the
> humidity with a dehumidifier. Anhydrous calcium carbonate, a
> dehydrating agent, is effective in removing moisture from the air in
> closets and other small spaces.

There are also chemical solutions to silverfish problems, but those can
also harm the books and other materials - these solutions are best left
to people with more expertise in these things, especially where a
library collection is concerned.
