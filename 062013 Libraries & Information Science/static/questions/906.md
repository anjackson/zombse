How to encode latitude and longitude in Dublin Core's dc.coverage? And in DSpace?
=====================
Dublin Core has a [coverage term](http://purl.org/dc/terms/coverage) and
a [spatial term](http://purl.org/dc/terms/spatial) and a [coverage
element](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/coverage). Both coverages can
refer to spatial or temporal elements, and can be specified however the
user likes.

What is the proper way to encode a specific latitude and longitude in
Dublin Core?

More specifically, in case this is different,
[DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/) uses Dublin Core, and includes
dc.coverage.spatial in its metadata fields. If I put a geolocated item
in DSpace, and I know its latitude and longitude, how should I put that
in dc.coverage.spatial?

Cynically: however you want; nothing will be able to use it.

Less cynically: Dublin Core has written up a "[DCMI Point
specification](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-point/)" that should
do what you want.

* Joe: damn them and their geo-centric spatial coordinate system! it's
completely useless for anything not on earth or in a geostationary
orbit. (although, it does solve the lat/long question)
* dsalo: You could always suggest an extension! ;)
* Joe: it's a massive can of worms .. I just e-mailed something to the
[DataCite](http://datacite.org/) folks as they had a proposal to support
"spatial" (again, they meant geo). But you have
[RA/Dec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial\_coordinate\_system)
for basic astronomy, but to explain it all, you need
[WCS](http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits\_wcs.html). Just as an example in
solar, we have lat/long, but that's from earth ... the sun rotates so
there's carrington lat/long for sun spots, plus polar coordinates for
CMEs ... but the telescope pointing is in x/y projections.
* Joe: Oh ... and my suggestion to DataCite was for them to pack it all into
Subject, with an identifier for the coordinate system used in
subjectScheme. (and do the same for the temporal & spectral
descriptions, which can also be pretty complex, as you try to explain
things recording as they're moving, with red shift, etc.)
* Trevor Owens: Alternatively, the simple GEORSS specs make a lot of sense too :)
