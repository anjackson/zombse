Both barcodes and qr-codes have the problem of taking up visual space on
the outside of the book.

Pro: The book readily identifies itself as a "library book" at casual
glance, significantly improving the return rate. Contra: It's ugly,
might cover other information, and sometimes there isn't enough or
suitable space on the spine, and the information needs to go onto the
front or back of the book, covering other information.

Some physical effects that could be used:

-   polarization angles, showing their pattern if viewed through
    polarized lenses, but clear to the bare human eye.
-   reflective/semi-reflective contrast might be more irritating to
    human eyes, and more prone to errors related to lighting.

Such a system could render the entire spine a barcode without blocking
view of the title or the traditional tag, further narrowing the "minimum
spine width" needed for identification.

Anything in use along these lines, or are there other downsides to it?
