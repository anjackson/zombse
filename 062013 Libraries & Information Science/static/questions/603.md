How are ebooks lent out from a library?
=====================
The ebooks I have seen are downloadable from the Internet, in common
formats such as pdf and djvu. I can store them in my computer as long as
I wish, and read them any time I want.

I am curious about how ebooks are lent to library members, as I have no
experience with this before.

What formats are they in?

Can the members keep the ebooks as long as they like, and store them on
their personal computers?

How are due dates enforced on ebooks?

Based on my experience with Overdrive:

eBook formats depend on what eBook reader you're using. There are
certain editions specifically for Kindles, Adobe EPUB, Adobe PDF, Open
EPUB, and Open PDF. It would just depend on what device you have. This
site can tell you what device uses what format:
[http://www.overdrive.com/resources/drc/](http://www.overdrive.com/resources/drc/)

There are 3 options for check out lengths: 7 days, 14 days, and 21 days.
You can pick which one you want at check out. There are no overdue fines
because at the end of the check out period, the book disappears from
your device (at the most basic level). If you have a device where you
have to sync it with your computer, then you could keep the item on your
device until it is synced.

Once an ebook's check out period ends you have to recheck it out to get
it again. Depending on how many copies of the eBook the library
purchased generally you'll have to wait if all the copies are checked
out.

### Comments ###
* Tim: (1) How can it disappear itself? By what technology (this raises my
concern of my computer security, as it is out of my control)? Has there
been some hacking ways to keep the book from disappearing? (2) Why the
time length so short, compared to print books, which has several months
length. (3) Is it always allowed to renew it indefinitely many times, so
that I can keep the book as long as I want?
* KatieR: What library allows you to check out books for months at a time? At a
public library, the most I've seen is a month at the max. And no, once
an ebook's check out period ends you have to recheck it out to get it
again.
* Tim: With ebooks, is it still the case that one has to wait for others to
return ebooks in order to borrow? This is what I dont like about print
books.
* KatieR: That depends on how many copies of the eBook the library purchased but
generally, yes, you'll have to wait if all the copies are checked out.
* Tim: Then what is the advantange of ebooks over print books? I thought that
would be the biggest one, but now there seems no difference.
* KatieR: Please see:
http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/80/what-unique-challenges-and-benefits-exist-when-lending-ebooks-compared-to-tradit
* Peter Murray: The ebook 'disappears' because there is a date encoded in the file for
when the checkout expires. It is a function of the software reading the
file to delete it (or, at least, not to complete the user's request to
open and read the file) after that date. Since you need the digital
rights management software to be able to read the book file, and since
it is programmed to honor this don't-open-after date, you won't be able
to read it.

I have to throw in a correction to the answer above. There is no device
I am aware of that allows the eReader app to simply remove the book when
the loan has expired. The eBook will show some kind of indication that
the loan period is expired and if the user tries to open it they will
get some form of error message that tells them they no longer have
access to the book.

All the eBook apps that I'm aware of do *not* remove the eBook from your
device because of security concerns. If an app has the power to erase
something from a device, then it presents an exploit that could be used
to damage data on the device. So to be on the safe side, the app makers
do not have that kind of access built into their software. The apps can
download and store, but they cannot remove. (At least not automatically,
the user has to initiate the deletion.)

There's another service that kind of competes with OverDrive called
[Freading](http://freading.com/index). We use it here at my library
system and it's another method of providing eBooks for our patrons.
Freading is different from OverDrive in several ways but the big two are
the fact that Freading doesn't really have much from the big six
publishers and how Freading does downloads.

See, with Freading, you get an allotment of tokens per week. The tokens
are virtual of course but they allow you to download a limit of books
per week. Here, we have four tokens per patron. Each eBook is a set
number of tokens. Some are one, some are four, but you get the idea. You
can download one four-token book (checks out for two weeks just like
OverDrive) or you could download four one-token books. The library is
paying Freading by the download so, unlike OverDrive, the eBooks are
always available. No holds, no waiting, no out of stock like you see
with OverDrive which has a model that's much more like a "traditional"
library collection.

Freading uses Adobe Digital Editions for authentication and they have
apps for iOS and Android. However any eReader app using ADE will work
with Freading too and even Freading recommends the BlueFire reader for
iOS or Android. Like OverDrive, it's a two week check out and the item
simply will not open after the loan period has expired. The user can
remove the eBook from their device, but the app will *not* do it for
them.

Another difference between OverDrive and Freading is the renewal
process. While neither of these services has a renewal mechanism built
in, the patron can simply re-download the book from Freading at a whim
if they didn't finish. With OverDrive, if the book is popular, and
there's a waiting list, then that person will have to wait to finish it.

* KatieR: My iPad Overdrive app removes the book...
* Bibrarian: Does it remove it automatically, or do you you have to remove it? What
I'm asking is that, after the loan expires, the book actually goes away
without you doing anything? If so, I've not seen that on my iPad. I've
got a title that's about to expire soon, so I'll be keeping an eye on
it.
* KatieR: I forget about my eBooks most of the time so by the time I go back to
it, it's months later and they're gone. So I have no idea how long they
take to disappear off the app.

The basis of content "removal" is that you do not control the operation
of the software. It is rather simple. Either by scheduled job, recurring
check by a resident process or by checking when the software is run (or
device connected), it compares the date of the downloaded content to its
expiration. Perhaps it deletes it outright, or perhaps it merely makes
it inaccessible or removes it from the index/display. The effect to the
user is the same.

Obviously the corollary is that the data itself must be stored (and
communicated) in a secure format, only made available to "secure"
devices, the software accessing it can't be modified, etc... all the
trappings of a DRM delivery chain.

Both publishers and libraries are having trouble adapting to an
electronic content model that doesn't need them as much or as *clearly*
as the print model did. The "eBook lending" model from OverDrive
artificially maintains the scarcity constraints familiar from physical
lending, largely because the two groups cannot agree how to do it any
other way. Meanwhile, many of the advantages of a digital medium are
sacrificed. For a good example of the friction, try the [\#HCOD
controversy](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&gs_nf=1&gs_mss=ebook%20#&tok=4DhYeUIa8UrJjYXZme0Sig&cp=11&gs_id=1s&xhr=t&q=ebook%20#hcod&pf=p&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&oq=ebook%20#hcod&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=2d917828f18b195b&biw=1440&bih=790).

There are other models of electronic content, for example:

-   [http://www.gutenberg.org/](http://www.gutenberg.org/) - Famously
    free ebooks

-   [https://unglue.it](https://unglue.it) - New bounty system paying
    authors to release works as open texts.

* Tim: Thanks! Has there been hacking on those ebooks to keep them permanently
available to readers? Has library and publisher start to worry about
that?
* Deborah Mould: @Tim, if you mean have libraries been involved in illegally breaking
DRM, then No. To find out more about what libraries are doing about
ebook lending, there are plenty of blogs, newspaper articles and
petitions out there that refer to this.
* Tim: @DeborahMould: I was not asking if libraries have been. Instead I asked
if there have been hacking by someone, anyone.
* Henry Mensch: @Tim: there has. It's hardly secret, and your favorite search engine
will turn up examples of this sort of thing. Here, however, we talk
about libraries and librarianship and breaking DRM isn't what libraries
do. Publishers are concerned about this sort of thing (that is, anyone
breakng DRM) and they react by limiting availability of their titles for
library loan.
* Joe Atzberger: Actually, this odd sense of propriety about \*not\* engaging on DRM
issues is part of what keeps libraries from having any leverage. IF
libraries built themselves a content platform for DRM publishing that
was demonstrably as secure or more secure than the current vendors, they
would be in a more effective position for procuring content. That would
require understanding DRM and relative vulnerabilities. The availability
of an item for loan does not significantly change the security profile
of its protected content if the same item is available \*for sale\* w/
equivalent or lesser protections.
* Tim: Is it good that libraries scan their print books and lend those scanned
efiles to its members just for internal non-public circulation, so that
there is no limitation by the limited number of copies of a book
available to lend out? I heard some university libraries did so, such as
Cornell University library.
* Deborah Mould: Educational institutions, such as Cornell, operate under an Educational
Licence, which means that they can reproduce articles/chapters/etc. in a
book of readings. But I haven't heard it extending to a whole book,
unless the title is out of print or the publisher has been unable to
meet demand.
* Deborah Mould: @Joe Atzberger, I think you make a good point for a new question thread.

In the academic library realm, every major library ebook provider that
does not offer DRM-free ebooks uses Adobe Digital Editions to manage the
DRM limitations, so each user must create an ADE login in order to
download ebooks to their computer or device. ADE will prevent you from
accessing the book once your checkout time limit has been reached. I do
not know if it deletes the book, but either way, you would have to check
it out again in order to read it.

I thought I would offer different alternatives to the e-book vendors
that are mentioned. The bigger vendors offer the same selections from
publishers, with some exceptions. Overdrive is the only vendor that
works with the Amazon Kindle. Almost all of them provide apps for
patrons to use for iPads/Smartphones. Formats range mostly in e-pub and
some Adobe PDF. E-Pub is the industry standard for file format.

Most of them work to allow check-outs consistent with your current
system. After the check-out expires the file will corrupt. If you are
using an app, the app will ask if you would like to remove the title as
it has expired. A patron can check-out the item again, but it doesn't
seem like they can extend the loan. The file is always locked in a
Digital Rights Management (DRM) system so that the file cannot be kept
indefinitely or shared. Here is a list of vendors available:

* Tim: Why is E-Pub the industry standard for file format? How good is it
compared to pdf and djvu?
* jdscott50: EPUB became an official standard of the International Digital Publishing
Forum (IDPF) in September 2007 (from Wikipedia). It is free, open, and
reflowable.
* Tim: (1) Ain't pdf and djvu also free, open and reflowable? Even much more
popular. (2) What does reflowable mean?
* jdscott50: Adobe runs PDF, while it is free it is a proprietary format subject to
the whims of the company. Reflowable means that no matter what you are
reading it on, the text can adjust. Often with PDF the images can look
wonky and the text can cut off or act strangely. Text is locked almost
like an image. It may not make a difference on simple text, but when it
gets more complicated, like images, page numbers, etc. it runs into
problems.
