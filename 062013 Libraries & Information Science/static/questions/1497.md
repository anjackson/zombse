Where can Israel's Official Gazette be found?
=====================
The website of the [Israel State
Archives](http://www.archives.gov.il/ArchiveGov_Eng/Our+Holdings/official/)
says that they have the **Official Gazette** in their collections:

> The collections include Rashumot, the Official Gazette (consisting of
> the Government Notices, Bills, the Book of Laws, the Treaty Series,
> etc), [...]

But the Official Gazette does not seem to be readable on their website.

How can a library get online access to this publication?

* jonsca: Just in keeping with the spirit of the site, I modified it just a tad,
but I think the answer will be the same.
* Nicolas Raoul: @jonsca: Thanks a lot! Actually I am not a librarian (just a Wikipedia
editor) but the modified question sounds more on-topic indeed.

----------------
PDFs of the Reshumot in Hebrew from September 2012 to the present are
available on the Ministry of Justice's website at
[http://old.justice.gov.il/MOJHeb/Reshumot/publication/](http://old.justice.gov.il/MOJHeb/Reshumot/publication/).
Links to other relevant official publications can be found at
[http://www.justice.gov.il/MOJHeb/Reshumot/](http://www.justice.gov.il/MOJHeb/Reshumot/).

Additional resources for for finding Israeli legal resources include the
Library of Congress' [Legal Research Guide:
Israel](http://www.loc.gov/law/help/israel.php) and Ruth Levush's
[Israeli Law Guide](http://www.llrx.com/features/israel3.htm).

This is a partial answer, though: it's not clear to me whether any of
the databases listed in the above links would enable a library to have
online access to all or part of the Official Gazette.
