Making my first Ebook and I have found FlexPaper and MegaZine3, is there
more software like these?

* Ashley Nunn: Welcome to Libraries! Unfortunately, software recommendations of any
type are off-topic here.
* Trevor Owens: For a little further elaboration, this sounds like a shoping question.
See this post to get a sense of some of the fine grain details on what
makes a shoping question (
http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping ).
Here are some suggestions for how this could be rephrased into questions
that would be legit. "What kinds of features should one be looking for
in software for creating ebooks?" or "How should one make a decision on
what kind of ebook creation software is best for a library?"
