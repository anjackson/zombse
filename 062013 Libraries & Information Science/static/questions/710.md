What field of study is concerned with creating new classification systems?
=====================
I know of a number of existing library classification systems (DDC, LC,
CC), but what area of library science is concerned with creating new
classification systems, and how one judges the suitability of such a
system?

You're asking for a classification for design of classification systems?

With this whole 'iSchool' push to get away from libraries, it's possible
some will call it [ontology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology) as
that's what it's called in computer science, but in LIS, it's [knowledge
organization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_organization),
which tends to be a little more broad, as it concerns itself with other
types of [controlled
vocabularies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary)

Ontology in LIS tends to be a specific type of controlled vocabulary in
which you can define any arbitrary relationships between the entries
(eg, in biology, you might define which animals eat which other animals
in the region you're studying)

As for judging for suitability, in many ways, it's like judging
databases -- can I ask it the questions that I need to have answered?
But there's also 'will I get useful answers?'

For this, you need to have:

-   Can describe the relationships needed (see this [taxonomy of
    KOSes](http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/KOS_taxonomy.htm))
-   All of the concepts that you are interested in are defined.
-   Sufficient specificity so that large numbers of items aren't placed
    into a single category (as this could impact
    [precision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall))
-   Something easy enough to use (not overly complex for your purposes)
-   Items that you considered to be similar are filed 'near' each other.

One important thing to remember is that classification systems don't
have to be fixed ... there are people that maintain them : clarify
entries, split them, merge them, or otherwise deal with language
changing or other changing needs of the users of the system.

(and for our final in "Construction of Index Languages and Thesauri", I
remember we had to judge a thesauri ... I took a sampling of concepts
that in the field, and then checked to see if they existed within the
system. Which isn't quite full use of the system, but that's really the
only way to really see if it works for you)

As said by Joe, the general area is **Knowledge Organization** and
information science has strong roots in knowledge organization with the
[International Federation for Information and
Documentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Federation_for_Information_and_Documentation)
(1895-2002). The [International Society for Knowledge
Organization](http://www.isko.org/) (ISKO) should provide some
references, but my personal impression is that ISKO somehow lost touch
to the technical development during the 1990s. For recent research in
knowledge organization I better recommend the [Networked Knowledge
Organization Systems/Services group](http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/) (NKOS).
Within the field of information science, knowledge organization has lost
importance with the rise of information retrieval and the shift from
documentation science to information science.

Classifications are just one kind of the systems, which knowledge
organization deals with. Despite the long tradition of classification
systems, I found that knowledge about these systems is often low and
practical application is poor. For instance one should know about basic
terms such as facet, precombination, and postcombination, instead of the
simplified image of a classification as a tree. In theory, revision and
evaluation should be applied regularly to classifications. In practice
some libraries even fail to cleanly track classification changes and to
create a simple histogram or tree-map with distribution of their
holdings in the classification. One reason is the lack of availability
of the classification system in a machine-readable form. For instance
the [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) ontology better fits to
thesauri than to specialized classification systems and many
classifications are hidden in proprietary library systems.

Maybe someone else can suggest a good textbook are best practice guide
to work with classifications. With a theoretical point of view I
recommend *[Sorting things out: classification and its
consequences](http://www.librarything.com/work/62760)*

* Joe: There are Dagobert Soergel's books (Indexing languages and thesauri:
Construction and Maintenance; Organizing information. Principles of data
base and retrieval systems), which cover construction and maintenance
issues, but the language is a bit dated so took me a while to really get
into (disclaimer: Soergel was my professor for thesaurus design). If you
want something less technical, I'm a fan of George Lakoff's [Women, Fire
and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the
Mind](http://www.librarything.com/work/63555).
* Jakob: @Joe Yep, I have Lakoff's book on my shelf and am a fan of Dagobert
Soergel, too. Soergel has good examples, which are difficult to find.
* Gustav Bertram: Both are good and useful answers, but I am marking Jakob's as correct
since his answer provided and lead to book titles. Thank you, guys!
* Jakob: Let us know if you find practical [software] tools to evaluate
classifications! Maybe this is worth another question.
