How do I find old magazines in obscure areas like LEGO Mania magazine?
=====================
There are some libraries that have old issues of it, as seen
[http://uwashington.worldcat.org/title/lego-mania-magazine/oclc/41416761&referer=brief\_results](http://uwashington.worldcat.org/title/lego-mania-magazine/oclc/41416761&referer=brief_results).

But I'm specifically interested in a central repository of such
magazines. Because if, say, I take them all out on an interlibrary loan,
it will cost a lot of money.

Also, this is a general question that doesn't only apply for LEGO Mania
magazine, but for all sorts of other magazines too.

* Ashley Nunn: Such a thing might not exist, and if it does, it may not exist for very
many obscure magazines. It is going to depend on the specific title.

The Prelinger Library
[http://www.prelinger.com/](http://www.prelinger.com/) often has very
obscure titles and ephemera that other libraries have not collected.
LegoMania isn't in the collection, but a lot of other American
periodicals are.
