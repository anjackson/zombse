Where would I find a downloadable list of subject headings or tags related to Science Fiction?
=====================
I'm looking for lists of authorized subject headings or tags related to
science fiction. I'd be interested in resources that compare different
sources as well.

You can try searching the Library of Congress Authority File here
[http://id.loc.gov/](http://id.loc.gov/)

You can search subject or genre for related headings

* ksclarke: I've heard the LCSH headings aren't that great/descriptive for SciFi...
any idea if that's true? (my first attempt at this question was a
subjective "which is best?" but stackexchange told me to reword it).
* jdscott50: LCSH can be a bit bulky. It's the file most libraries use for authority
control though.
* Ed Summers: The narrower terms for [Science
Fiction](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85118629.html) are
somewhat disappointing. I wonder if there is a collection of science
fiction bibliographic records that could be trawled for subject
headings...
* dsalo: IME it's generally safe to assume that LCSH for any kind of fiction is,
um, suboptimal. I'd honestly look at a LibraryThing tag cloud in
preference, and I'm not all that fond of tag clouds.
* jdscott50: LCSH aren't very descriptive. Their very existence as authority records
guarantees that they will be vague. Are Tags authoritative? Can they be?

Not sure what you mean by downloadable. Are you hoping to create a
starter set of tags for a catalog?

The BISAC list of fiction subject headings is here:
[http://www.bisg.org/what-we-do-0-100-bisac-subject-headings-list-fiction.php](http://www.bisg.org/what-we-do-0-100-bisac-subject-headings-list-fiction.php)
Notice that science fiction has subheadings, and it is also a subheading
for other genres.

LibraryThing shows 2873 tags, 789 subjects (LCSH), and 1900+ tagmashes
for science fiction:
[http://www.librarything.com/search.php](http://www.librarything.com/search.php)

Tags, by their nature, are of course not authoritative. This is
LibraryThing's entry for the Science fiction tag (including 400+
aliases/misspellings) showing the most common related tags. Clicking on
related tags brings up additional lists of possibly related tags.
[http://www.librarything.com/tag/science+fiction](http://www.librarything.com/tag/science+fiction)

As far as I know, Sears subject headings are only available to people
willing to pay for them.

* ksclarke: Yes, looking for a starter set for a project.

An off the wall solution might be to use Wikipedia. A few months ago I
wrote [fastcat](https://github.com/edsu/fastcat/) that downloads English
Wikipedia category data (as SKOS from dbpedia) and indexes it with
Redis. It then provides a little python API for the data stored in
Redis, that allows you to easily walk around in the category information
following broader and narrower relations.

For example once you've installed fastcat you can do this:

    import fastcat

    cat = fastcat.FastCat()
    print cat.narrower("Science fiction")

Which will print out:

    ['Science fiction by franchise', 'Science fiction culture', 
    'Transhumanism', 'Science fiction genres', 'Science fiction people',
    'Science fiction lists', 'Science fiction themes', 
    'Science fiction by nationality', 'Science fiction organizations', 
    'Science fiction literature', 'WikiProject Science fiction', 
    "Clarion Writers' Workshop", 'Science fiction awards', 
    'Science fiction studies', 'Science fiction templates', 
    'Science fiction by medium']

which isn't terribly useful. But with a bit of recursion you could walk
around a bit deeper:

    import json
    import fastcat

    cat = fastcat.FastCat()

    def lookup(name, depth):
        sub_cats = set()
        for sub_cat in cat.narrower(name):
            sub_cats.add(sub_cat)
            if depth > 0:
                sub_cats = sub_cats.union(lookup(sub_cat, depth-1))
        return sub_cats

    scifi = list(lookup("Science fiction", depth=5))
    scifi.sort()

    print json.dumps(list(scifi), indent=2)

Which yields a 3,930 long [JSON list](https://gist.github.com/2875622),
which might also be useless, but perhaps interesting. Maybe there is a
way you could preserve the hierarchy to make it more useful, or crawl
topics that are a bit broader than Science Fiction.
