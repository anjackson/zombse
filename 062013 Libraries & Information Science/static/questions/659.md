=====================
Academic libraries are libraries with the primary purpose of serving
members of their post-secondary educational institutions rather than,
e.g. members of the general public or another sort of institution.

This is part of a non-overlapping categorization of libraries along with
[public-libraries](/questions/tagged/public-libraries "show questions tagged 'public-libraries'"),
[school-libraries](/questions/tagged/school-libraries "show questions tagged 'school-libraries'")
(for primary and secondary education),
[government-libraries](/questions/tagged/government-libraries "show questions tagged 'government-libraries'"),
[corporate-libraries](/questions/tagged/corporate-libraries "show questions tagged 'corporate-libraries'"),
and others. Many or most academic libraries are also
[research-libraries](/questions/tagged/research-libraries "show questions tagged 'research-libraries'"),
although that tag should not be included if not immediately relevant to
the question.

This tag should be used to indicate questions about academic libraries
as an institution or that would almost exclusively occur in the context
of academic libraries.
