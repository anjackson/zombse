What are the various types of Patron Driven Acquisitions that public libraries use, and which are the most cost-effective?
=====================
Right now I have found these:

Purchase on demand

E-reserve PDA

Reference collection PDA

Print on Demand (Espresso Book Machine)

PPV (Pay Per View) ebooks

Are there others?

And what do other librarians think about providing Patron Driven
Acquisitions? I'd like to hear from some librarians who have working
experience with it.

Thanks!

Those are all that I am aware of. We have been doing a pilot of ebook
PDA at my academic library, using the profile we have set up for books
that the librarians would select from normally. They go ahead and
purchase whatever they know we absolutely need, and the rest are left in
the ebook PDA for the users to select if they determine it's a book they
can use. It's been very effective in catching titles that the librarians
would have in their "maybe" column without having to buy all of them.
