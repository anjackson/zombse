What are the tradeoffs between the various email archiving approaches?
=====================
Specifically, as email archives continue to grow quickly, are
organizations finding that conventional archiving of files in [Personal
Storage Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Storage_Table)
(PST) or [Notes Storage
Format](http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Notes_Storage_Facility_%28NSF%29)
(NSF) working at the organizational level working? Or is there a need
for more policy-based approaches due to the way that individuals rely on
their personal email archives?

* jonsca: Could you edit the question a bit to relate this to libraries directly?
As of now, it's leaning towards being off-topic.
* Jakob: See also the related question on [archiving mailing
lists](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/684/do-libraries-archive-mailing-lists-as-part-of-their-collection)
* Jakob: The Wikipedia article [Electronic message
journaling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic\_message\_journaling)
might help to rethink the question and modify it to become more
specific. Right now it's a very broad question so no concrete answer is
possible.
* anarchivist: What do you mean by "archiving"? Are you talking about long-term
preservation that is ultimately access driven?
* Joe: Why would you archive anything other than mbox? (although, you need to
document [how you escape '\^From'
lines](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4155))

For anyone serious about preserving e-mail, and by that I mean more than
just saving the files, one must migrate them to a format that will be
accessible in the future. The *de facto* standards for preserving e-mail
messages (and attachments) are MBOX and EML.

There are several tools for migrating PST and NSF files to a more
preservable standard. These include commercial tools like Aid4Mail, and
open source solutions like EMCAP from the NC State Archives.

Preserving attachments is much more difficult, for obvious reasons.

I would suggest reading Christopher Prom's excellent report, "Preserving
Email." DPC Technology Watch Report 11â€“01 December 2011.
[doi:10.7207/twr11-01](http://dx.doi.org/10.7207/twr11-01) Much of what
is written above came from Prom's article.
