Applications to browse MARC (maybe with statistics)?
=====================
I am looking for apps to view and browse MARC records. I'm a programmer
so I usually interact with MARC via [marc4j](http://marc4j.tigris.org/)
or [pymarc](https://github.com/edsu/pymarc) and the
[like](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Working_with_MaRC#MARC_Programming_Libraries).
But sometimes, I'd like to have a GUI, which could show me the content
of a MARC file (one or more records) and probably render some statistics
on the fields (e.g. field coverage, top values, etc.)

What tools do you use to browse, view, explore (and maybe edit) MARC?

Edit: Preferred platform, OS X or Linux. (I already saw the list on
[http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Working\_with\_MaRC\#Desktop\_tools](http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Working_with_MaRC#Desktop_tools),
but as they still listing MS-DOS tools, there might be some fresher
things out there).

Well, I suspect
[MarcEdit](http://people.oregonstate.edu/~reeset/marcedit/html/index.php)
is what you want... but you'll need a Windows environment to run it. Any
of the various ways to run Windows on a Mac should be fine, but I don't
know if it will run on the WINE emulator for Linux. Anybody else know?

* dsalo: Aha. The developer installs it on OpenSUSE:

* miku: Thanks, well Windows is okay, as I can always spin up a VM with
VirtualBox - it just adds a little friction.

Terry Reese (the creator of MarcEdit) provides resources for installing
and running it in a Linux environment:
