How to uniquely identify multiple copies of same book in a library
=====================
Basically, my question is how to uniquely identify multiple copies of
same book in a library. Call numbers are not unique to particular copy
of the book unless we append 'copy 1','copy 2' and so on (Correct me
here if I am wrong).

What would be the best thing to do? Have same call number for all copies
of the book and assign a unique accession number, have unique call
number for each book and don't use accession number at all, or have
unique call number and unique accession number for each book?

* Jakob: As far as I know, nowadays the barcode (or RFID identifier) is the most
unique way to uniquely identify copies.

I'm not sure what kind of software you are using, but each item needs
its own material number that identifies it uniquely. Most libraries use
barcodes because they are scannable, and when you order them, they are
produced sequentially so that no number is accidentally used twice. You
can create your own item stickers or your own barcodes even, if you have
budget constraints - you just have to be careful about numbering.

In a typical ILS (integrated library system software), you have linked
databases. The bibliographic database contains information about the
material (MARC record fields with title, author, and other descriptors).
The holding database contains information about individual copies and
may contain fields like cost, call number, status, and circulation
history. The two databases are linked by the material number field (the
bibliographic databases allowing multiple material numbers to be
associated with one record).

Having unique material numbers allows you to identify which copy a
patron has out, which is particularly at issue when an item is lost or
damaged. The call number is not sufficient for this. Call numbers are
used to group like items together and to make items easy to find on the
shelf. Four copies of *The Hunger Games* should all have the same call
number.

In the picture below from our software (Biblionix) the bibliographic
record is on the left. It is linked to 13 holding records on the right,
each of which can be individually selected and edited.

When I was not automated (your question sounds like you are not), we had
an accession book - each item had a unique accession number, just a
sequential one and we listed author, title, publisher, date, vendor and
price in the book.
