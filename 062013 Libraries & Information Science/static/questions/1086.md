What's an effective way to communicate the value of risk assesment for digital collections?
=====================
What have been effective ways that you or your organization has used to
communicate the value of doing a risk (or risk/value) assessment for
digital collections? I'm interested in energizing groups to act to
preserve their digital holdings but would like a more effective approach
to communicating the importance of specific action for specific digital
materials.

* Joe: Not an answer to the question, but at the
[BRDI](http://www.nationalacademies.org/brdi) meeting last week, the
representative from [IMLS](http://www.imls.gov) said that they were
looking into establishing 'regional hubs' for digitalization efforts,
most likely at state libraries, where groups could go to get access to
scanners & such.
* dsalo: I don't see why this would be any different than a risk assessment for
analog materials.

I have not done a formal risk assessment at my current organization, but
the subject comes up regularly through budget talks, meetings and
long-term planning. [David Rosenthal](http://blog.dshr.org/) researches
this topic along with the economics of digital storage - I always find
his work a good resource.

Specifically, [Requirements for Digital Preservation
Systems](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/rosenthal/11rosenthal.html)
(2005, Rosenthal et al.) has a **taxonomy of threats** section that
helps (me, at least) go over risks a digital collection is exposed to:

-   Media Failure
-   Hardware Failure
-   Software Failure
-   Communication Errors
-   Failure of Network Services
-   Media & Hardware
-   Obsolescence
-   Software Obsolescence
-   Operator Error
-   Natural Disaster
-   External Attack
-   Internal Attack
-   Economic Failure
-   Organizational Failure

You could present this list to your audience and ask them to engage on a
few of them - if they can attach numbers to any of those threat types,
along with helpful actions, all the better.

The paper also covers economic risks from a number of angles - as it
argues:

> Information in digital form is much more vulnerable to interruptions
> in the money supply than information on paper.

Honestly though this is a problem I face myself in training government
records producers - it can be tough to communicate these risks in a
powerful way. Sometimes I show them some a [corrupted image

attention!

This is a very narrow slice of digital preservation risks, but it's a
good visual approach that can make an impact. Euan Cochrane put together
a comparison of how software render files differently.

Here are some of his [visuals depicting rendering
differences](http://archives.govt.nz/resources/information-management-research/rendering-matters-report-results-research-digital-object-0)
and here is the [full
report](http://archives.govt.nz/sites/default/files/Rendering_Matters.pdf)
(.pdf).

A few people have called on students to find and document more
real-world rendering problems. This can help communicate the difficulty
of born-digital problems very effectively, much like the [Stanford
scanning defects
reference](http://lib.stanford.edu/digital-production-services/quality-assurance-image-defects).

* Jay Gattuso: Euan's example actually shows a very different risk to the one he
proposes. The risk that's documented is the risk of using the wrong
software to render a file.

Take a digital copy of a valuable piece of paper. Print it out in high
resolution. Next... To show bitrot, punch a few holes in it. To show
compression, wrinkle it into a ball, unwrap it and straighten it out.

This humorous way always gets the discussion going.

It is important to build an understanding of risk in a more formal
context, from the ground up through training courses, such as M\_o\_R:
[http://www.mor-officialsite.com/](http://www.mor-officialsite.com/) or
other such courses that teach the ISO standards etc.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_31000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31000)

It is important not to simply assert 'risk' but actually give staff the
ability to think critically about it, involve them by getting them to
think of the importance of digital preservation within the organisation
and the threats to the organization and its objectives - it is important
not to forget about opportunities too!

Taking walker's example further, courses would enable staff to come up
with their own lists of threats from the obvious to novel, and also help
iron out perceived risks in favor of those that can be written clearly
and then measured.

In my former role we did an M\_o\_R course with staff and managers
there. It provides everyone with a language to talk about risk thus
improving everyone's ability to communicate.

There were some simple exercises which helped explain how to make a risk
statement, what documents were important and how to go about
establishing a *risk management culture*. In learning that it is an
evolutionary process and you won't simply leave the room doing 'risk
management' we learnt that there were some small exercises we could
begin with as a team that would act as a beginning and might evolve into
something more.

We left the room to begin work on restating a risk-register using a more
formal structure *[Cause. Event. Effect]* - *[Because of... There is a
risk that... Which will result in...]*. In learning small things like
that could automatically improve how we worked there was an immediate
energizing effect (and grounding effect too in some cases!).

...In a digital preservation context?
-------------------------------------

The principles above are very general, and can apply across the
organisation and discipline.

In a digital preservation context the additional structure more formal
approaches can put around statements like the *importance of specific
action for specific digital materials* - can help everyone to see
whether the digital materials are at risk *or* not, what the impact is,
and the range of responses you might take as a group to handle that
risk. It improves accountability, communication, cooperation and
understanding throughout the management chain through to the staff.
