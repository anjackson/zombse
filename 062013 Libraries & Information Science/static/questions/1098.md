Are there federal requirements in the United States that govern the retention of patron circulation records?
=====================
In our town library during my lifetime, the circulation records of book
checkouts started out as being on paper, and as the library grew, they
were partially computerized, and then fully computerized.

Given that the paper records are much more difficult to retain and keep
track of, is there a federal requirement for retention of circulation
records for any length of time? Who is entitled to access these records?

* Gem: By "circulation records" are you talking about the initial borrower
sign-up form or the record of checking out items from the library?
* jonsca: @Gem Thank you, I meant a list of all of the books that have been
checked out by a particular patron. Hopefully that's clearer now.

In the state of Colorado, there are no requirements to keep any specific
borrower information. However, if your library stores the information,
it could be required, by government authorities, to turn over the
records it has.

Exactly how much circulation information is stored varies library by
library. The integrated library system (ILS) we use provides a couple of
different options. We store everything the borrower has currently
checked out. Once the borrower checks that item in, it comes off their
checkout record. However, their name stays associated with the item
record until the next borrower checks the item out (this is in case we
discover the item was damaged or is missing a DVD, etc). In addition, we
have the option to store additional checkout history if we wished. The
version of Horizon we use provides the options to only keep the basic
circ history (detailed above), provide an opt-in for individual patrons
to keep their circulation history, or turn on circulation history
collection for all patrons.

Of course, we also have database backups. So, while technically checkout
information disappears from the patron records as soon as it gets
checked in, in reality we do have a set number of days in backups that
would contain additional checkout information.

Regarding who has access to this data: This tends to vary state by
state. ALA, the American Library Association, has a page that offers
links to various state laws:
[http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/ifgroups/stateifcchairs/stateifcinaction/stateprivacy](http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/ifgroups/stateifcchairs/stateifcinaction/stateprivacy)

Colorado's statute is as followers:

> Colorado Law 24-90-119. Privacy of user records. (1) Except as set
> forth in subsection (2) of this section, a publicly-supported library
> shall not disclose any record or other information that identifies a
> person as having requested or obtained specific materials or service
> or as otherwise having used the library. (2) Records may be disclosed
> in the following instances: (a) When necessary for the reasonable
> operation of the library; (b) Upon written consent of the user; (c)
> Pursuant to subpoena, upon court order, or where otherwise required by
> law; (d) To a custodial parent or legal guardian who has access to a
> minor's library card or its authorization number for the purpose of
> accessing by electronic means library records of the minor. (3) Any
> library official, employee, or volunteer who discloses information in
> violation of this section commits a class 2 petty offense and, upon
> conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three
> hundred dollars.

Note that even parents don't have access to their child's record unless
they have their child's library card or number.

My understanding, and I'm not a lawyer, is that Federal laws don't say
who can't access the record but rather who can. One of the big debates
within library circles for the past decade deals with the USA PATRIOT
act. Basically, in certain circumstances it allows Federal authorities
to have access to library records without a court order. See the
references below for more information.

* jonsca: Excellent, thanks! I'll have to look into the Patriot Act a bit further.
Thanks for giving a point of reference to your state's policies as well.

I know the ALA has passed a [resolution in
2006](http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/statementspols/ifresolutions/libraryusagerecords)
on this matter. The suggest that most information about circulation
should actually be destroyed at regular intervals unless it pertains to
the running of the library (paid fines, etc). So in one sense, you
shouldn't keep the record around at all if you can help it.

* jonsca: Interesting, how does that mesh with compliance with the \`PATRIOT\`
legislation mentioned in the other answer?
* cchelberg: Basically, if you don't have the information, and that the discarding of
such is done in a regular way, they can't ask for it due to a policy
decision. One of my classes on Library Science history says that this
policy came about during the Cold War to thwart the FBI.
* jonsca: Useful, thank you!

Having been at UC Berkeley when an FBI request came in (late 1960s/early
1970s), I can tell you that many or most good libraries get rid of past
circulation records in order to protect patron privacy. Many state
constitutions (including California's) provide legal protection for such
records, but the safest route is not to have them. (At the time, there
was no such constitutional protection...but the records weren't kept, so
it didn't matter.) Judges can't override protections to gather records
that don't exist.
