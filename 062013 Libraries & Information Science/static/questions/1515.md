What physical properties of a document are recorded in an archive?
=====================
Documents have physical properties such as materials of construction,
binding, damage, annotations, etc.

What characteristics are important enough to record? How is this data
recorded when the document is added to an archive?

----------------
While we rarely describe individual items that are added to an archive
(at least, not if they are part of a larger collection), it is unusual
for us to record individual physical properties. We make exceptions for
items with significant damage (the kind we would want to document and
track), those made out of materials that could prove hazardous to the
items around or near them, or those which contain annotations
attributable to a VIP (whether that person is important to history in
general [Abraham Lincoln, for example], or simply important within your
collection scope).

As for how we record them, usually a descriptive record (catalog or
finding aid), or in separate documentation in a collection file (which
contains other important documentation like gift agreements).
