What examples do libraries have of patrons making use of library developed open APIs (i.e., catalogue API)?
=====================
There have a been a number of libraries developing open APIs to their
systems and data (where they're able to license the data appropriately).
Usually these APIs help make the libraries internal processes more
efficient and effective. However, I am interested in examples where open
APIs have been used by users to create their own applications. What has
been the impact of these developments and have they been incorporated
back into the library's own services? Has the development of these open
APIs helped innovation flourish beyond the library?

For me the canonical examples of external use of Library APIs are [Jon
Udell's Libary Lookup](http://jonudell.net/LibraryLookup.html) project
and [Library Thing](http://www.librarything.com/). Calling vendor
specific URL patterns and Z39.50 APIs may seem like a stretch, but I
think they really are. The Worldcat API has a
[listing](http://oclc.org/developer/applications) of third party
applications that were built by people outside of OCLC. The [Chronicling
America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov) website at the Library of
Congress has an [API](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/about/api/) that
is used by services such as [archives.com](http://archives.com). I
imagine there are lots of other examples, I'd love to see them here. For
example here is a [listing of mobile
apps](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mobile/) that use APIs at the National
Library of Medicine.

I think your questions is a really good one, because we need to do a
better job of highlighting the ways in which our APIs are used. We also
need to make sure that use is the driving factor in how APIs are
designed and implemented, rather focusing on whether it uses some
blessed standard.

* Ben: Thanks Ed. These are some fantastic examples. I am aware of a few
(mostly from the UK) and agree with your statement that we need to be
better at highlighting how these APIs are being used.

Here's an example of a blogger from my hometown who wrote a Perl script
to get an RSS feed of new DVD acquisitions at the local public library.

[http://ruk.ca/content/more-opac-fun-rss-feed-new-dvds-public-library](http://ruk.ca/content/more-opac-fun-rss-feed-new-dvds-public-library)

He also made a script to create an RSS feed of the books you have
checked out at the library:

In an [email to the Code4Lib mailing list in October
2011](https://listserv.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1110&L=CODE4LIB&T=0&F=&S=&P=81898),
Randy Stern of Harvard's library said their [Data Lookup Web
Service](http://hul.harvard.edu/ois/systems/webservices/) was used by
projects out of the [Harvard Library
Lab](http://osc.hul.harvard.edu/liblab). I realize that's two units in
the same institution, but it shows a library API in use.
