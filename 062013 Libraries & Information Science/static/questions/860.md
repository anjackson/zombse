How do I access full resolution scans from the Internet Archive?
=====================
I'm working on a workflow for extracting images (especially) from
Internet Archive book scans and I'm wondering if someone has already
written up a way (using the API) to access the full resolution images
that could then be cropped. I've searched via Google for some tutorials
but haven't found anything specific enough to my needs.

That depends on exactly what you'd like to do (download the entire set
of images from a given item, embed a single image in some other kind of
page, etc.) and how you'd like to be able to specify which images are
desired. If you can provide a bit more detail, I'll be glad to advise.

(Thanks to Jason Scott for bringing this question to my attention.)

While I'm not sure about your image in particular, it was announced that
Internet Archive is making 1 million items available via bit torrent:

That might be a good place to start.
