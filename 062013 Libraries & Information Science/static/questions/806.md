Where to find TOC of books in copyable text forms?
=====================
I would like to know how to find the table of content of a book

1.  in a text-copyable format, because I may want to copy out the text
    of the toc (my order of preference: html or ASCII text format,
    non-scanned text-copyable pdf, scanned and OCRed pdf because OCR may
    not give well-aligned lines when copying out the text)
2.  preferably in complete form, i.e. down to the lowest level and
    containing page numbers, just as what we can see in the TOC part of
    a print book.

Are there some websites of libraries, organizations or databases
providing such TOC information?

Alternatively, are there some indirect way to get around if there is no
such information available for a specific book?

For example, I am looking for the table of content of "Foundations of
financial markets and institutions" Fourth Edition by Fabozzi.

1.  By searching the book in Google, it gives a link to a scanned and
    OCRed pdf file for its content at
    [http://swbplus.bsz-bw.de/bsz304528544inh.pdf](http://swbplus.bsz-bw.de/bsz304528544inh.pdf).
    But I hope to know how to find the pdf file for the book's TOC on
    the main site
    [http://www.bsz-bw.de/index.html](http://www.bsz-bw.de/index.html),
    so I searched the book title there and reached
    [http://swb2.bsz-bw.de/DB=2.1/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=2&ADI\_LND=](http://swb2.bsz-bw.de/DB=2.1/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=2&ADI_LND=),
    but now I wonder where the pdf for its TOC is?
2.  Since the format in 1 is scanned and OCRed pdf, I also hope to know
    if there are other sites providing better text for TOC?

Note that I am not just looking for table of content of this book, but
also for a book in general case.

Thanks and regards,

Tim

* Jakob: The swb2... URL is not stable, you can link to this book with
http://swb2.bsz-bw.de/DB=2.1/PPNSET?PPN=320963403&INDEXSET=1
* Tim: (1) About the tags, why does TOC have to do with cataloging? (2) @Jakob:
What does "URL is not stable" mean technically?
* Jakob: (2) I mean, it is no permanent URL but only valid within a session with
browser cookie. This is just one example of why old library OPACs suck.
(1) the better tag is
[catalog-enrichment](http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA423795.html)
because ToC are usually used for this purpose in libraries.

[WorldCat](http://worldcat.org/) often includes tables of contents; on
an individual book's page scroll all the way down past the libraries
that hold the book to find the "details" section. [Here's an example of
a book with a
ToC.](http://www.worldcat.org/title/wealth-of-networks-how-social-production-transforms-markets-and-freedom/oclc/61881089&referer=brief_results)

Because of the vagaries of cataloging, you'll notice that the
punctuation is a bit odd. It should be consistently odd, so if you need
to strip it for some reason, you should find it doable.

* Tim: Thanks! In your example, the toc is not as detailed as the toc of the
printed book: not down to the lowest level of sections, and no page
numbers.

There is not one single source of ToCs. In addition to WorldCat and SWB
I recommend:

-   Google Books
-   Amazon (some Books have preview)
-   GBV union catalog (see for instance
    [http://www.gbv.de/dms/zbw/58763202X.pdf](http://www.gbv.de/dms/zbw/58763202X.pdf),
    linked at
    [http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/PPNSET?PPN=58763202X](http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/PPNSET?PPN=58763202X)
    which by the way is equal to the PDF from SWB)
-   The publisher's homepage (last hope)

The ToCs available at GBV and SWB are created by
[http://www.agi-imc.de](http://www.agi-imc.de) (as specified in the PDF
metadata). The company scans 1,3 million ToCs a year for German library
networks.

### Comments ###
* Tim: Thanks! (1) Google Books and Amazon's book preview don't allow to copy
the text out. (2) Scanned and OCRed pdf by GBV often doesn't have lines
well aligned when copied out. Nonetheless, both are better than none. To
give the due credits, the project in Germany is very great.
