Is there a way to look up Ariel addresses?
=====================
I work in Interlibrary Loan, and one of the main parts of my job is
sending articles through Ariel. Sometimes, the picklist sheets I am
given are missing part of the Ariel address, which means I usually have
to use a less convenient method to send the item.

I know for most Canadian institutions I can use the Library and Archives
site to look up the addresses, but for American or international
addresses, I am usually out of luck. Is there a way for me to look those
up as well?

* Nic: Not sure about Ariel, but if you ever need to look up Z39.50 targets
then [IRSpy](http://irspy.indexdata.com) has a nice database.

A couple resources I've found are:

-   The [Australian Interlibrary Resource Sharing
    Directory](http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/ilrs) -- entries contain Ariel
    addresses where available, and the advanced search lets you filter
    by libraries that accept delivery via Ariel.
-   The [OCLC Policies Directory](https://illpolicies.oclc.org/)
    includes Ariel addresses.

The Google Groups mailing list for Relais ILL is fairly active with
institutions that use Relais ILL as their Ariel server. Browsing
historic posts serves as kind of a de facto database. There's a link to
sign up on the Relais contact page.

Also, the University of Guelph has a comprehensive (though somewhat
dated) list.
