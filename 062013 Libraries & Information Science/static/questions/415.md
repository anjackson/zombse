Where can I find published library technology guidelines online?
=====================
I know library technology standards are a moving target, but some of us
try. DOes your state publish library technology standards?

I've helped with Colorado tech standards for more than a decade - our
latest version is from 2011. The effort was lead by Jim Duncan of the
State Library, and Carolyn Colter of the Pikes Peak Library District
rounded out our team. The tech standars were a subset of overall library
standards revisions in Colorado.

The published standards are here:

A promo video is here :0) :

* Peter Murray: When I read the headline my first thought was "NISO", but I see that
isn't the kind of 'standards' you are talking about. Can you edit the
title to remove that ambiguity? Perhaps the word 'guidelines' instead?
* Carson Block: Peter- that's a good catch. Thank you!

In Australia, we have a few public library standards which may be of use
to you. Fortunately, they are all linked from this page:

In the UK JISC publishes the [Standards
Catalogue](http://standards.jisc.ac.uk/catalogue/Home.phtml) which is a
very comprehensive list of technology standards in use in the UK further
and higher education sectors (and inevitably in other sectors as well).

The big issue with these kinds of 'catalogues' or directories is keeping
them up to date and making sure new and emerging standards are surfaced
in the resources.

I assume you're the same Carson Block that asked this in the ALA Think
Tank Facebook group, but for those who aren't in the group & all
posterity: [Library Edge](http://www.libraryedge.org/) is working on a
set of public access technology benchmarks for libraries. They have a
[beta release](http://www.libraryedge.org/beta-benchmarks-pages-4.php)
out that looks pretty great. The benchmarks not only highlight services
that libraries should provide but also basic assessment measurements.

A couple others I've seen:

-   [Texas Public Library
    Standards](https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/plstandards/tech.html) - some
    very concrete metrics, great example for public libraries
-   [ISTE Standards](http://www.iste.org/standards.aspx) - standards for
    teachers, students, administrators...seems focused on elementary
    schools

* Carson Block: Yes - I'm the same Carson! Thank you!
* Carson Block: Library Edge has great promise, especially in taking a broader approach
and applying assessments. Having worked in Colorado for many years (now
I'm working throughout the country) I assumed that all state libraries
in kind developed and published public library standards. I've
discovered that our state libraries are much like public libraries in
general -- highly reflective of the communities they serve!
