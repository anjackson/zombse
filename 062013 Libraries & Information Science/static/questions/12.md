Has archive.org removed or deleted sites from its database?
=====================
I've seen many archive.org pages that I could no longer access because
after the site got deleted, a domain took over the site and put
robots.txt restriction protocol over the site...

There seem to be a few threads about this in archive.org's forms, such
as [this
example](http://archive.org/post/401293/parked-domains-robotstxt-disallows-viewing-of-past-content).

It seems to be an issue that they know about but are choosing to keep
the status quo about. My guess is because there'd be no reliable way to
tell that a 'new owner' is not just the same group who happened to
change domain registrars, etc. without having to devote many more
resources than they have available to check over all of the domains in
their archive.

Probably. [From IA's own T&C's](http://archive.org/about/terms.php):

*While we collect publicly available Internet documents, sometimes
authors and publishers express a desire for their documents not to be
included in the Collections (by tagging a file for robot exclusion or by
contacting us or the original crawler group). If the author or publisher
of some part of the Archive does not want his or her work in our
Collections, then we may remove that portion of the Collections without
notice.*

I wouldn't be surprised if they collect first and ask permission later.
