What is the indexing/matching/ranking algorithm of the LOC newspaper archive?
=====================
When searching the "[Chronicling
America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/batches/batch_ohi_guildenstern_ver01/)"
pages, on the LOC web site, I am wondering if my lack or results is due
to OCR errors. How is that archive indexed? Does it index OCR's words,
or character n-grams? The advanced search page has an option to search
within a word window, which is often useful, but if the words themselves
are poorly recognized, word-based searching will not be as effective as
n-grams might be.

Does anyone know the search engine is organized?

I work as a software developer on the Chronicling America project. We
index the OCR with [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/), which is a
web service wrapper around the [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core)
search library. Lucene's [scoring
algorithm](http://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_0/scoring.html) uses
[Vector Space Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Space_Model)
and [tf-idf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%2aidf) for ranking. What
this basically means is summed up in the Lucene document:

> In general, the idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term
> appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears
> in all the documents in the collection, the more relevant that
> document is to the query.

This is why you often see pages with lots of pictures, and little text
on them, at the top of search results, since the ratio of the matched
words to the words on the page is higher than pages with more words on
them. Sometimes we joke that the search is actually a historic comic
strip search engine :-)

The OCR quality does vary from newspaper to newspaper, depending on the
quality of the microfilm that was digitized, and the quality of the
newspaper that was microfilmed. It can be *very* noisy indeed. We
actually expose the OCR for pages, which you can get by clicking on the
"Text" hyperlink when viewing a newspaper page. Here's an
[example](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn89066313/1912-05-24/ed-1/seq-1/ocr/)
There are links to a plain text and OCR XML version of the OCR at the
bottom.

We are actually in the process of bundling up the newspaper OCR for bulk
download so that researchers, partners and other interested folks can
index the content easily. If you have any ideas for improving search, or
questions about failing searches we would love to hear them. There are
knobs to turn in Solr for boosting fields, and changing the way indexing
is performed, so there is definitely room for improvement.

The Chronicling America codebase is currently available on
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/loc-ndnp/), and you can
email the [mailing
list](https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=loc-ndnp-mail)
if you want to get in touch. I hope this helps!
