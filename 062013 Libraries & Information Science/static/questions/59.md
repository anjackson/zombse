Good examples of libraries/archives that provide a single web entry point into all unique collections?
=====================
Our library has been trying to envision what a single web portal into
all of our unique digital and special collections offerings would look
like. We've got two separate special collections and archives
departments with two websites, a digital collections website, a digital
exhibits page, and our ETDs, all in separate silos.

For us,

**Exhibits** are curated digital items representing a larger physical
collection, lots of text, sometimes in tandem with a physical exhibit
(think Omeka)

**Digital collections** are entire collections as-is, usually lots of
items, little to no accompanying description (think CONTENTdm)

...not to mention that we'd like to in some way represent the
collections that we haven't digitized.

If you know of institutions that are presenting a graceful single web
interface into all of their unique collections, please send them along.

Well, I know of "discovery layer" implementers who solve the problem
through new-generation OPACs. [The University of Wisconsin's new
Blacklight-based catalog
interface](http://search.library.wisconsin.edu/) harvests metadata from
the IR and digital collections via OAI-PMH for search and display, for
example.

* Erin White: Thank you! UW's interface is beautiful. I like the mix of discovery and
search and the integration with all other library resources.
* dsalo: I'll pass on the compliments to the library dev team. :)

My two favorites in this are are [Dukes digital collections
site](http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections) and the [National
Library of Australia's Trove](http://trove.nla.gov.au/). I love how
trove draws attention to collection areas and to the daily activity of
civizen librarians and archivists who are working on enhancing the
quality of the collection. Duke's site has a great look to it as well.
The Library of Congress recently rolled out a [single search across all
the collections](http://www.loc.gov/search/?q=&fa=digitized%3atrue) as
well and it has some nice features to it. In particular, I like how it
responds to Null search requests, and how it defaults to faceting to
digitally accessible content but with one toggle becomes a search of all
the rest of the records as well.

* Erin White: Thank you! These are great sites as is @dsalo's UW example. It's been a
couple days so I am marking this question as answered.

Yale has one, though it's certainly not comprehensive of content at the
University:
[http://discover.odai.yale.edu/ydc/](http://discover.odai.yale.edu/ydc/).

In North Carolina's research triangle, UNC-Chapel Hill, Duke, North
Carolina State, and North Carolina Central have a shared catalog that
doesn't just has bibliographic records, but also indexes full text of
finding aids from those institutions' archival branches (though not
museums), and is also starting to include digital content (though not
all yet). You can find this catalog at
[http://search.trln.org/](http://search.trln.org/).

I love the way how the [world digital library](http://www.wdl.org/)
exposes their assets on a map. You can brows by various facets such as
topic, language, item type or institution; all results can be narrowed
with a time slider - neat.

The Library of Congress has a "search box" that provides a gateway into
content found in a variety of subsystems (the online catalog, Prints and
Photographs catalog, Thomas, the Veterans History Project, American
Memory, etc). The web application is built using Django and Solr, using
metadata obtained from crawling the various websites with Apache Nutch
and extracting known HTML
[metadata](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mdc/docs/html-metatags.pdf) for
indexing with Solr. There are also specialized loaders to bypass
crawling, for datasets like the Voyager online catalog. For an example
check out the search results for
["whitman"](http://www.loc.gov/search/?q=whitman&fa=digitized%3Atrue).
