Auto-logging into Aquabrowser catalog system
=====================
I'm looking to auto-login to Aquabrowser's catalog system using their
own form. By using Javascript I pulled the barcode and pin information
in and populated the forms, but triggering the login button causes the
whole page to refresh and load in the body frame. Also I was just
sending the information through the URL, I'd prefer to post the data but
I'm not sure how to retrieve it on Aquabrowser, it uses xls which is not
something that I am that familiar with. Has anyone had any luck with
something like this?
