How to shelve a collection of teaching aids?
=====================
Our Library has a collection of Montessori teaching aides for our
education students, but they are all shelved at the same shelf number.
Does your library house a Montessori collection? If so, how have you
shelved it? Pictures Welcome

I don't have experience with Montessori teaching aides, but taking a
look at [Deakin University](http://library.deakin.edu.au/search~S1/)
they appear to have shelved their Montessori collection using various
combinations - but a common one is the use of a secondary alpha set that
takes the first letter of the first three words of the title.

E.g. *Montessori education: yesterday, today and tomorrow* by Marian
O'Donnell is at call number 371.392 ODO/MEY. *Bringing the Montessori
approach to your early years practice* by Barbara Isaacs is 371.392
ISA/BTM

At a university I worked at some time ago, we did create a special
education area for children with disabilities which had a prefix (TAA),
used the relevant DDC number about the topic being taught (i.e. TAA
641.5 for cookery, TAA 700 for arts) and filed these in at the rear of
the collection so that they could be identified quickly.

It did create some confusion for the students however, who definitely
preferred to go to the same area they had always gone to for teaching
materials and search the shelves manually, rather than locate them on
the catalogue and wander up the back.

My library doesn't use Montessori teaching aids in particular, but we do
have what we call kits. These are collections of themed materials
usually included books, a video or audio CD, puppets/play food/puzzles
or other hands-on toys & learning materials. These we store in mesh bags
that have a laminated card listing the contents & a barcode. Some are
library creations, other commercial kits we purchased.

They have their own shelves, though a hanging rack may work better,
especially for a larger collection.

Demco used to sell a collection that I'm unable to located using their
website that they called Discovery Packs. This illustrates the hanging
back option of storage:
