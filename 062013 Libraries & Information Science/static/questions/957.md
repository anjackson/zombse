=====================
Digital preservation is the active management of digital content over
time to ensure ongoing access. It includes issues relating to ensuring
the authenticity and availability of digital objects and information,
the obsolescence of file formats, considerations of the longevity of
storage media and systems, and the emulation and migration of digital
information. The goal of digital preservation is long term access to
digital content.
