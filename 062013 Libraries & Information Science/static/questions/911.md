Credit/Debit Card Machines in Libraries
=====================
Does anyone use credit/debit card machines in their library so patrons
can pay for fines, booksale items, etc? We're thinking about getting a
machine to start offering the service. Any suggestions on how to get
started?

talking about ATMs?

Some ILSes have modules that interface with card-readers to pay for
fines and such. I'm pretty sure that's how it works in my library.
Perhaps check with your ILS vendor to see what is available. (I don't
work in that department, I'm sorry I can't be more helpful there).

Since you mentioned "booksale items, etc." one thing you may look into
is some of the newfangled payment systems like
[Square](https://squareup.com/). Square allows you to run credit/debit
cards through touch devices, similarly to how you check out at the Apple
Store. This more portable system may work better for things like
booksales and payments that would not be directly tied to a patron
account.

It all depends on your ILS, I think. Where I work we use SirsiDynix's
Symphony, and accept in-person card payments in it using a device from
[Moneris](http://www.moneris.com/), a Canadian company that handles
credit and debit card transactions. There's no way to do online
payments, because Symphony does't allow it (or, perhaps, we haven't
bought that module).

Our staff don't have the capability to accept credit card payments but
our 3M self-checks do as well as
[SmartPay](http://www.comprisetechnologies.com/?page_id=32), an online
service that is linked from our web page. Both communicate via
[SIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Interchange_Protocol) with
Horizon, our ILS, to automatically update the patron's account. So far,
both services have been working very well for us.
