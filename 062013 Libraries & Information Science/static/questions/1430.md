Where to find previous titles of serials?
=====================
Part of the challenge of cataloguing serials is that these publications
change their titles not infrequently (in both major and minor ways). I
know that MARC has fields for varying forms of titles and former titles
(246 and 247 fields respectively, I think). Is there a place (authority
record?) then to look up all the titles that a particular publication
has been published under? How could I find these records if they exist?

Such information would be valuable for researchers working with, e.g.,
historic newspaper collections.

The best fields for showing related titles are the 76X-78X - see the
MARC manual
[http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd76x78x.html](http://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd76x78x.html)
The 246 is for a variant title of the title you're currently looking at;
previous / later / related titles are in the linking entries field.

As far as I'm aware, one of the better resources for finding periodicals
titles (apart from trawling through the related titles entries for each
record!) is Ulrich's Periodicals Directory. This contains previous /
later titles. It's also online as Ulrichsweb
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich%27s\_Periodicals\_Directory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrich%27s_Periodicals_Directory).
Unfortunately, this is not a free resource.

Natasha is correct. There are no "title authority" records for serials
that track all the title changes. Why? Well title changes are not always
one-to-one relationships. Often titles merge, split, die, are re-born,
etc.

The current rules call for successive entry cataloging, meaning each
unique major title change gets a separate bibliographic record. Each
physical form (online, print, microformat, etc.) also gets it's own
separate record.

We track title change info in 780 (earlier title) and 785 (later title)
fields. This includes merges and splits. We also use 787 (other
relationship) and 776 (other physical form) fields for complicated and
print-online changes.

247 fields were used in latest-entry cataloging and are now used for
integrating resource title changes.

246 fields track minor title changes, as well as variant titles,
parallel titles, other title information, commonly known titles, etc.

Ulrich's is a good resource, but even that isn't always complete.

Another option to see all the variant titles is with the OCLC xISSN
service
([http://www.oclc.org/developer/services/xissn](http://www.oclc.org/developer/services/xissn)).
This provides information on all titles related to an ISSN.

There are a number of sources to assist in researching a title history.

-   UlrichsWeb (as previously mentioned...it is not freely available but
    many large public and academic libraries subscribe so you might be
    able to find a library near you that has access)

-   ISSN Network. ISSN are assigned by a network of 88 national centers
    around the world. Again, not freely available but on a case-by-case
    basis, individual national centers are willing to research
    individual titles. See the ISSN website (issn.org) for more
    information

-   OCLC xISSN service (as mentioned by Shana). Just a caveat, the
    information is provided by individual OCLC contributors and may or
    may not be accurate (as knowledge about serials cataloging standards
    can vary greatly among libraries). However, ISSN and title
    information will most likely be accurate for serials published in
    the U.S.

-   SUNCAT (UK Union Catalogue of Serials). It's purpose is to show
    holdings of the major UK libraries, but it includes feeds from both
    the CONSER file and ISSN database so it's a relatively comprehensive
    database (and free to boot!!).
    [http://www.suncat.ac.uk/](http://www.suncat.ac.uk/)

-   Library of Congress catalog. Dependent on LC holdings but reliable.
    As with most library catalogs, set your search limit to Serial.
