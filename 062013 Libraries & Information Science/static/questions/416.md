What is a good way to sell withdrawn books?
=====================
If one does not have a book sale program (e.g. via a "Friends"
organization), or one has books that might find a better home and raise
more money than at such a sale, are there other viable ways to sell
withdrawn books?

I'm wondering if it is workable to use some service like Amazon,
Alibris, Ebay, or some consignment service or dealer to better handle
the withdrawals and benefit the library. Is this reasonable only for
exceptional items, or can it work for run-of-the-mill weeded books (in
good condition)? What might be involved?

The ALA has a fact sheet on organizations that accept book donations:

I manage our local friend's donation & resale program ... I don't
personally deal with selling them online, but here is my understanding
of the situation:

1.  Not all books will make a profit online, especially if the books
    have been withdrawn due to wear.

2.  Those books that might sell at higher prices to make it worthwile
    (to cover your time + shipping to justify it all) may take some time
    to sell ... so you need to have sufficient storage to hold that
    stuff that might make a profit.

3.  Most of the folks who scour book sales for re-sale purposes have
    some sort of barcode scanner on their cell phone -- they can scan
    the UPC, check the prices online, and then decide if it's worth
    their buying or not. Those scanners (ASellerTool, ScoutPal) tend to
    have a monthly subscription fee (\$10-30 currently). I've never
    tried them, so I don't know how it compares to what's provided from
    isbn.nu (which in their [about page](http://isbn.nu/about.html)
    mentions they may block you if you hit them too hard)

4.  Every used bookstore in the English speaking world already has a
    copy of 'Cooking with Rosie' and at least two books on the Atkins
    diet.

As we don't have the time (or space) to deal with what we deal with now,
if it were me, I'd try to find someone near you doing the book reseller
thing, and try to strike a deal with them, so they just give you a flat
rate per book, but it's not taking up your time stocking a book cart,
etc, and then you can donate what's left to whatever organization are in
your area. (I send children's books and textbooks to [Books for
International Goodwill](http://www.big-books.org/), I also give to the
local [Habitat for Humanity ReStore](http://www.habitat.org/restores/))

And even for damaged books, some stuff still can be reused -- I've got
an artist who makes collages from other ... but it has to be glossy
paper, non-photographs ... I can push boxes of children's books on her,
even when they're falling apart.

... and if you want to do the online selling yourself, you may want to
read one of:

We are using [Better World
Books](http://www.betterworldbooks.com/go/donation-library) as a partner
to find new homes for our recent collection evaluation project. They've
been awesome to work with.
