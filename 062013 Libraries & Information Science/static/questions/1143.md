How to preserve a glossy magazine?
=====================
We have received a glossy magazine. We'd like to preserve it long-term.
What are the preservation issues with glossy magazines? For example, are
they usually acidic, and if so, does the glossy paper react well to the
usual methods of de-acidification?

Note: This particular item is bound with glue, but to make this a more
generally useful question, please address any methods of binding
(including staples) which may be relevant to other glossy magazines.

I believe you shouldn't need to deacidify this magazine. The alkaline
coating should protect the paper core, even if the paper is acidic.
Library of Congress lists four criteria for exclusion their mass
deacidification program, including works in which . . .

"Text paper is coated or super-calendered (coated paper is not a high
priority for deacidification, due to its alkaline coating)"

See:
