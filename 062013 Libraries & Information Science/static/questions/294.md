How to discourage patrons writing and marking into books?
=====================
Some patrons return books with margins full of comments, underlined
text, even luminescent text markers have been applied.

Use of RFID-based return machines skips the check applied by most
librarians, and once the book has been returned, it's hard to lay blame
on a particular patron.

Are there any successful means to actively discourage patrons from
writing into books?

Or, in other words, to actively encourage patrons *not* to write into
books?

Printed and preformatted note-taking paper, like the [Fast Book
Outliner](http://davidseah.com/blog/node/the-fast-book-outliner/) by
[David Seah](http://davidseah.com/productivity-tools/) may be an answer.
The sheet can be folded to go into the book as a bookmark, and the
patron can use it to keep track of his progress through the book,
marking down his ideas and refer to the pages he wants to return to.

There are several layouts for printout, for example:

![50 pages per sheet](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BK6Hl.jpg) or ![100 pages
per sheet](http://i.stack.imgur.com/T47ra.jpg)

It offers the patron the added benefit of still being available to him
once he returns the book, and in case he decides to borrow the same book
again, he can continue his work right where he left it, building on his
own notes.

It would probably even be possible to commission a customized version,
incorporating library specific design and information.

* Melissa: I've never heard of this before; it would be extremely useful in the
textbooks that are on the library shelves, which seem to have the most
issues with defacing.

Even if no one is inspecting the books, the inclusion of a notice such
as
`"Patrons who mark in or on books under any circumstances could be charged for a replacement up to double the book's cost and be suspended from borrowing for up to 6 months, depending on the nature of the infraction"`
will deter most individuals not doing so out of malice.

A cursory inspection of, say, 10% of the books returned via RFID should
also net some of the culprits. Even if you can't narrow it down to an
individual for sure, you can maintain a sealed "high probability" list
for comparison's sake.

* alxp: Signs like that also deter people form thinking of the library as a
place they want to be in and borrow books from. One slip up and you lose
your library privileges means 'forget it, I'll just go to the
bookstore.'
* Tatjana Heuser: It's not lack of knowledge that writing in library books is considered
damaging the book on purpose. Those patrons who are writing into books
and colouring them as if they were a stack of xeroxed copies do so,
because they deem their personal imminent need (to use the book the way
they want) more important than the rules of use (or fair use). Some
faculties are a lot worse than others. Deterring didn't help so far, we
need to be more creative (and positive) and offer them something
\_they\_ prefer to damaging our books.
* jonsca: @alxp Not to be blunt, but if the patron needs a copy they can write in,
they \*should\* be going to the bookstore. Also, posting such a notice
doesn't imply that the library has to act on it.
* jonsca: @TatjanaHeuser I concede that your solution is the more creative, and
probably productive, of the two. Mine is more of a "please don't walk on
the grass" solution, it appeals to the conscience, and while many will
walk as they may, it might send the more responsible user off to get
their own sheet of paper :)
* Eliah Kagan: One problem with this kind of aggressive signage is that offenders
aren't the only patrons who see it. It's a burden to patrons who respect
the materials, and some patrons may even take it as a challenge. Or,
counter-intuitively, \*as permission\* to write in books (because
patrons who already feel entitled to mark books up may see it as
confirmation that [if it's ever really considered a problem, they'd be
paying to have it dealt with
anyway](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/books/chapters/0515-1st-levitt.html?\_r=1)).
* jonsca: @EliahKagan Everyone \*should\* see the message, though. It should be a
deterrent for the casual user that says "scrawling my notes in the
margin won't hurt anyone," and for that group it would be the most
effective. Those that are going to challenge the system are going to
challenge it regardless. I understand your economic reasoning, but I
think asserting such a truth in this situation would require studying
the problem specifically in libraries.
* Eliah Kagan: @jonsca I said the problem is \*offenders\* aren't the only ones who see
the message, not that \*serious offenders\* aren't. Most users probably
don't scrawl in books, and it is a burden to those users, discouraging
them from using and supporting the library (as alxp commented). I do
agree that my economic reasoning is speculative and that a study
specific to libraries (or even more specific to a particular kind of
library, e.g., public, academic) would be needed to confirm (or reject)
it.
* KatieR: I agree with @alxp, but I also believe in making a library into a
friendly and enjoyable place to be. Some librarians want their libraries
to be cold & heartless. If you don't plan on acting on the threat, why
even put it up? How will a sign with a threat that isn't acted on going
to stop chronic book defacers?
* jonsca: @KatieR I wasn't suggesting anything should be put up (that was the
other answer), but be put into the books. I don't consider a notice of
rules to be unfriendly, it's just a notice of rules -- if people don't
break them, there's no problem. I wouldn't consider a "DON'T WALK" sign
on a city street to be a deterrent to my enjoyment of a stroll down the
block.
* jonsca: @EliahKagan Why does a sign outlining the rules discourage you from
using something?
* Eliah Kagan: @jonsca (I'm wondering why you didn't ask this when alxp made the same
point.) I think that being constantly reminded that you are subject to a
punitive authority when you use your library will discourage people from
seeing the library as a welcoming place that they are safe and free to
use. When the message is combative (as in this case), I think it will
also make it less likely that patrons will see the library as \*theirs\*
(to use, cherish, and protect).
* Eliah Kagan: I'm not saying policies imposing fines and suspensions of privileges
shouldn't exist. But they do need to be carefully written, and all the
more so when it is decided that they will appear prominently, as a
constant reminder. Your proposed wording ("defacing books under any
circumstances") is extreme and would offend any patron who is paying
attention. Do you really think patrons should be comfortable with the
idea of having their borrowing privileges suspended if they spill coffee
on a book? Do you think a patron who has read this policy would stand up
and take responsibility if they did?
* jonsca: @EliahKagan From the original question: "successful means to actively
discourage" is what I was responding to. Please take my word that I'm a
very easygoing person, but if someone starts running over my lawn with a
car on purpose, I'm not going to wave and say "Thanks, please come
again!!" Safety also comes from knowing that you'll have a book that
isn't written in. Clearly, the easygoing measures are not helping the OP
in their quest to rid their library of this problem. This is the only
reason I would suggest escalation.
* jonsca: @EliahKagan Spilling coffee is not defacing.
* KatieR: Maybe to you but to a patron they might not realize that. You would have
to list all the things that are "defacing" to really set the regular
user at ease.
* jonsca: @KatieR There's some more "legalese", see if that softens the blow a
bit. :P

Under the idea that
[positive](http://stephenslighthouse.com/2010/12/21/new-2011-library-signage-plea/)
[library](http://oxfordstaffdev.wordpress.com/2009/08/02/library-signage-2/)
[signage](http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/columns/my-mind/signage-better-none-bad)
is preferable, I created a sign to read:

Thank you for not writing in our books!

Simple and to the point. It took care of the person who was making
editorial corrections, but if you have a more serious concern, jonsca's
notice & selected inspection suggestions may be more applicable.

I've also seen libraries use a tipped in 'initial here to mark that
you've read it' slip for those who are determined to put their mark in
the corner to make sure they don't check out the same item years
later--no longer quite as useful if you're part of any ILL system.

* Tatjana Heuser: That's a very important point, I like it, and it would also make the
idea of offering them an alternate route to notetaking probably a lot
more effective.

Who is putting the books back on the shelves? Even though RFID tags
might cause the books to skip the librarian, there is still a human
putting them away, correct? I realize that it is near impossible to ask
your pages (at least that's what we call them in the public library
world) to check every book they put away, we encourage them to notify us
if they find something wrong with a book. It doesn't always help in
tracing back to made the offending marks (unless they are brand new
marks & your ILS allows you to see who had the book last) but can help
in maintaining the collection.

I wonder if a notice along the lines of, "Please indicate your desire to
purchase this book by writing in it" would work? :-)

Adults who write in books know they are not supposed to. Signs have
limited impact on a good day when read by honest people, and they are
generally useless for people who know they are dong something wrong and
do it anyway. You have to find the culprits and speak to them directly
(even if they deny culpability, they will know they are being watched).

To catch the offenders, it is best to inspect books before they are
shelved (if you wait till the damage is caught later, you make your job
much harder). At our library, whenever a material is returned with
damage of any kind we contact the last person who had it and discuss it
with him. If we have to leave a message, we temporarily block the
account so he has to contact us in order to continue using the library.
Sometimes the person will offer a plausible explanation of
non-responsibility (usually, the book was that way when he got it), so
we thank him for his help and then just put a note on the account in
case it develops into a pattern.

We had a member who was hand "deckling" the edges of some of our books.
We had a suspect, so we pulled some of the other items the person had
checked out recently and we found other "deckling." It could be that the
suspect just liked the same authors as the deckler, so we were careful
not to accuse outright when we called. If a book is returned with
writing, you can start with the person who returned it last and then
look at some of the other items she checked out recently to see if there
is a pattern. If you there is no pattern and you feel it is
inappropriate to ask about it because too much time has elapsed, you can
still put a note in the account in case it happens again.
