What's a good elevator pitch to a layman asking "What's digital humanities/humanities computing/[insert local jargon here]?"
=====================
As my profile (and business card) currently state, I'm a "Digital
Human(ist)," but I've never found a good way of explaining what that
means in \~15â€“30 seconds that makes me sound like something more than an
English Lit. major with a computer. It's hard to make an argument that
the experience is valuable or that digital humanities need
funding/hiring/whatever if I can't even explain to people what it is.
So: Elevator pitch.

* Jenn Riley: Do you need to define the humanities in that 15-30 seconds, or is that
part of your intended audience's knowledge base already?
* M. Alan Thomas II: Usually I'm dealing with academics who know what "humanities" means, but
I wouldn't mind an answer that's applicable to a wider range of
professional experience (and hence helpful for more other people).
* trevormunoz: Is it possible to make clear(er) how this question is particular
relevant to LIS? Is the goal here to talk about how as librarians we can
present ourselves as being part of digital humanities? Or is the main
thrust of the question about how to explain digital humanities (to other
librarians?).
* M. Alan Thomas II: @trevormunoz While as a cross-disciplinary field, DH finds homes in a
lot of different places, it can be considered at least partially
information science and is frequently taught as such; indeed it's why I
went into LIS (at Illinois) in the first place. I would assume that it's
as relevant a question to "libraries and informations science" as the
relevant elevator pitch for librarianship or any other sub-field within
our broad topic. To your question, though: Librarians might be, but are
not necessarily, on either side of the conversation.

"I analyze broad swathes of human experience in ways that weren't
feasible before computers and digital materials." Add specifics
depending on what you actually do -- text-corpus analysis is a different
animal from GIS is a different animal from X-raying palimpsests.

Assuming that you only need to explain the "digital" part, and not what
the humanities are (I have no idea how you'd even begin to do that!),
the first issue I see is that one person's digital humanities is not the
next person's. Definitions of the field are typically very wide, so your
practice is likely very different from others'. Which makes it hard for
anyone other than you to come up with a definition of what you do. You
might find it useful to say both that you use technology for the process
of the research itself and to convey its products - I find some folks
assume only the latter is what's happening. Some other aspects of a
definition that might help: increasing the scale of analysis beyond
what's possible in the analog world, insights into analysis gained from
collaboration with technical staff, introducing (and sharing with
others) fundamentally new methods of analysis, and just opening up your
portfolio to new technologically enabled things to do. That still sounds
like an English major with a computer, but frankly, I think that's OK.
DH is a sea-change, but it's a clear next step and not a hard break with
"non-digital" humanities, IMO.

And of course, as dsalo implies, a 1-sentence example is worth 10
minutes of general explanation.

Bringing digital objects, tools, and methodologies to bear on
traditional humanities scholarship.
