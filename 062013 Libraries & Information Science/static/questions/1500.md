The manuscript Summa Logicae (William of Ockham)
=====================
The *Summa Logicae* (Latin, in English it's *the Sum of Logic*) is a
textbook on logic by [William of
Ockham](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_S5dFdpF6xm0/SuC3NlxHmwI/AAAAAAAAAj4/zGiXgFk3NK0/s400/William-of-Ockham-Moscarlop-GNU-free.png).
There are articles about *the Summa Logicae* [in
Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_logicae) and [in
Logicmuseum](http://www.logicmuseum.com/wiki/Summa_Logicae_%28Ockham%29).

It was published in Paris in 1488. There are different typed variants of
this textbook, for example
[here](http://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/articles/Ockham.Summa_logicae.pdf)
(in English).

But I can't find any scans or photos of the original handmade manuscript
or the original (first) edition. Do you know any links or libraries or
museims, where I can find it?
