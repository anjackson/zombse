=====================
Academic libraries are libraries with the primary purpose of serving
members of their post-secondary educational institutions rather than,
e.g. members of the general public or another sort of institution.
(Libraries for primary and secondary education fall under
[tag:school-libraries].) This tag should be used to indicate questions
about academic libraries as an institution or that would almost
exclusively occur in the context of academic libraries.

M. Alan Thomas II
