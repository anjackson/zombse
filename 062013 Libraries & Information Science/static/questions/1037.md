How should a digitization effort for a library proceed?
=====================
If a library is looking into forming a digitization team dedicated to
digitizing your rare & special collections:

1.  How should what gets digitized be determined? Should this be focused
    more on monographs, or should items like maps/ephemera be
    considered) If the librarian cannot or will not determine these
    decisions, who should?
2.  Is there a standard that should be followed for digitization?
3.  Is there a standard that should be followed for preservation?
4.  Where should this unit live within the library organization - as
    part of rare books? part of tech services? another unit?

* Jakob: This are relevant topics but it's a bunch of questions instand of one.
There will unlikely be one answer. You may better asks for existing
surveys andy particular aspects to get a general picture of digitization
in libraries.
* Jakob: How about if you ask multiple questions instead and ask for general
practice instead of anecdotal reports (avoid the work 'you')? Thanks!
* Mary Jo Finch: +1 I think any library that is digitizing special collections will have
considered all of these questions, and while technically anecdotal, the
information would be useful to another library considering digitization.
The sub-questions allow for easy organization of answers for comparison.
* jonsca: @MaryJoFinch (and \`@jambina\`) While I respect your opinion, in keeping
with a tradition of creating a repository of material in an SE Q+A,
rather than a collection of anecdotes, I have made the question more
general
* jonsca: Jambina, there are a lot of questions here. You might want to consider
breaking up the ones that are not as closely related (like where a
Digitization department should live within the library).

I came across an interesting set of resources for digitization today.
It's called [*Digital Preservation in a
Box*](http://dpoutreach.net/?page_id=11), created by the Library of
Congress's [National Digital Stewardship
Alliance](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsa/working_groups/)
(NDSA). Resources include tools and discussions of format and risk
issues. It's too much to really encapsulate here, but it does address
some of your questions. The [Library of Congress
Standards](http://www.loc.gov/standards/) are on their website, but may
be more technical than what you are looking for.

An additional, exhaustive set of online resources can be found on the
[Digital Curation Resource
Guide](http://digital-scholarship.org/dcrg/dcrg.htm). The list includes
links to discussion groups, file formats and guidelines, sample library
policies, standards, software and tools, and blogs. The list was
compiled by Charles W. Bailey, Jr., formerly Assistant Dean for Digital
Library Planning and Development at the University of Houston Libraries.

* MGallinger: The Digital Preservation in a Box materials are relevant to digitized
holdings, but they are really useful for any digital collections --
including born digital materials. They really are a good resource.

The [LIFE-SHARE
Project](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/projects/lifeshare/) produced a
useful set of resources that help to take the reader through the process
of establishing and implementing a digitisation activity, as well as
guiding dissemination and preservation (See the [Digitisation
Toolkit](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/projects/lifeshare/maps.html)).
There is also an end to end [case study on digitising Special
Collections](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/projects/lifeshare/casestudy2.html)
which made these recommendations (summarised to keep this response
concise):

-   Consider implementing an online form for receiving digitisation
    requests
-   Scan all images which are to form archival master images in a
    repository in uncompressed or lossless compression formats
-   Create technical standards for all images created and check that
    equipment used is fit for purpose
-   If storing images digitised as part of an on-demand service in a
    repository, it is important to identify images for storage at the
    point of capture so that they can be digitised to the appropriate
    standards
-   Try to use existing infrastructure if it can be adapted to your
    purpose

The project also explored [consortial
models](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/projects/lifeshare/models.html),
how they might be applied in order to create shared digitisation
services, and what aspects of interaction were important in order to
create effective partnerships (trust, communication, coordination, etc).

3.Is there a standard that should be followed for preservation?

An ALA task force is documenting the minimum recommended tech specs for
digitization. It's only in draft now, but it's well-cited and concise.

Guidelines on digitization for various materials (still images, moving
images, audio...) can be found at the Federal Agencies Digitization
Guidelines site:
[http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/](http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/).
Their project planning materials
[http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/digitize-planning.html](http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/digitize-planning.html)
may be of some use in exploring how to tackle digitization efforts.
While your organization may make some different choices, these
guidelines should be a useful starting point for your organizational
discussion.

Unpacking the first part of the first question....

**How should what gets digitized be determined?**

Creating a policy to prioritize or queue items for digitization is
nearly impossible to perfect. That's an anecdotal observation from
working on digitizing special collections projects for two years as an
academic librarian at 75% time with digital curation and 25% time with
special collections. The primary reason is priorities will change on a
near daily basis.

Factors influencing (remixed from
[NEDCC](http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/6Reformatting/06PreservationAndSelection.php),
[JISC](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/library/projects/lifeshare/casestudy2.html),
[NDSA](http://dpoutreach.net/?page_id=11),
[LOC](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/), &
[RBMS](http://www.rbms.info/committees/task_force/digitization/discbiblio.shtml)
among others) the development of a prioritization policy could include
(I won't say they are ordered, as that would put into question the
veracity of my already anecdotal answer):

-   institutional/university policy
-   organizational/departmental mission statement
-   collection development policies
-   collection management policies
-   national laws and regulations
-   user needs
-   funds
-   digitization equipment
-   evaluation of subject experts
-   condition & stability
-   market trend
-   value/risk

I'd like to add some small advice on Paul Wheatley's answer regarding
file formats. Archival master images should always be saved as
uncompressed files, as compression comes with some problems. If i. e.
just one bit in the compressed image flips, the rest of your master
(behind that bit in the bitstream) is useless and lost. Also,
compression uses up cycles on your archival servers that will be better
used doing other things like creating downscaled copies of your master
images for presentation.
