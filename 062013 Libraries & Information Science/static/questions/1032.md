Why do some books have multiple ISBNs?
=====================
As described [in this
question](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/984/what-is-the-difference-between-isbn-10-and-isbn-13)
books can have both, ISBN-10 and ISBN-13. In addition, however, some
books have multiple ISBN-10:

> Stochastic Processes: A Survey of the Mathematical Theory (Applied
> Mathematical Sciences) [Sep 01, 1977] Lamperti, J. ISBN: 0387902759
> ISBN: 3540902759
>
> Ordinary Differential Equations [Paperback] [Jul 01, 1997] Vladimir I.
> Arnol'd; Vladimir I. Arnold and Roger Cooke ISBN: 3540548130 ISBN:
> 0387548130

Why do these books have multiple ISBNs? Thanks!

Answer by Jakob
----------------
Each ISBN is assigned by a publisher. The publisher can buy ISBN ranges
from an ISBN agency, which gets its ISBN prefix from the [international
ISBN agency](http://www.isbn-international.org/). Based on these
assigned [ISBN ranges](http://www.isbn-international.org/page/ranges),
one can read the parts of an ISBN. For instance the ISBNs from your
example:

-   **0-387**-90275-9 = English agency - Springer - 90275 - check digit
-   **3-540**-90275-9 = German agency - Springer - 90275 - check digit

In this case
[Springer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springer_Science%2BBusiness_Media)
is a German publisher, so it belongs to the German agency (`3-`).
Springer seems to have decided to assign two ISBNs because the book is
English (`0-`), for better visibility or just because of some internal
business rule. I'd bet that foreign books are less present in book
stores and in libraries. With two prefixes for German countries and for
English countries the publisher might have a slight advantange. Maybe
the editor just insisted to get an English ISBN for his book.

By the way, OCLC provides [a web service to decode
ISBNs](http://www.oclc.org/developer/news/guessing-publisher-isbn-prefix),
for instance
[0387902759](http://xisbn.worldcat.org/webservices/xid/isbn/0387902759.js?method=hyphen)
is:

    {
        "isbn":["0-387-90275-9"],
        "area":"English speaking area",
        "publisher":"Springer",
        "city":"Berlin"
    }

### Comments ###
* Tim: Thanks! (1) can you point out which parts of 0-387-90275-9 means which?
(2) It seems not all Springer books have two 10-digit ISBNs. For
example, Representations of compact Lie groups by Brocker and tom Dieck
has just one ISBM 3-540-13678-9. (3) The book in (2) also has ISSN
0072-5285. What does ISSN mean?
* dsalo: ISSN is to journals (the "s" stands for "serials") as ISBN is to books.
* Tim: @dsalo: But Representations of compact Lie groups by Brocker and tom
Dieck is a book, not a journal.Why does it have ISSN?
* dsalo: Because it's part of the series "Graduate Texts in Mathematics" to which
that particular ISSN refers. Book series as well as journals can receive
ISSNs.
