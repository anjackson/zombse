Characterization of WARC files contents?
=====================
I am looking a tool that given a
[WARC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive) file produces and
presents a characterization of the contents included in this archive.

The goal is to have a quick broad characterization of a collection of
web resources.

### Comments ###
* mopennock: As this question is about characterisation (and by association, digital
preservation) as much as web archiving, could you add a
digital-preservation tag?

I bookmarked these some months ago, but I've not checked recent updates
on their development:

-   [NetarchiveSuite \> WARC support in
    JHove2](https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/WARC+support+in+JHove2)
-   [NetarchiveSuite \> WARC implementation
    Roadmap](https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/WARC+implementation+Roadmap)

* Andy Jackson: I think you may be able to build the current version from here:

* Andy Jackson: Actually, the closely related JWAT-tools might be your best bet:

You might want to take a look at some of the [UK Web Archive
code](https://github.com/ukwa/). There are examples of converting a
[WARC to a
ZIP](https://github.com/ukwa/warc/blob/master/warc/warctozip.py) and
also [mounting as a file system using
FUSE-J](https://github.com/ukwa/warc-fuse), but these are not used at
the moment (the former because the warc-to-zip conversion is not
finished, the latter because it is too slow for our purposes). Our
current preference is for running the WARC characterisation on Hadoop,
and so we use [code specific to that
platform](https://github.com/ukwa/warc-discovery) to dissect the WARC.
We also started writing [extensions to Apache
Tika](https://github.com/openplanets/nanite/tree/master/nanite-ext/src/main/java/uk/bl/wap/tika/parser/warc)
to make it able to parse WARC files, but these have not yet been
polished up and made easily available.

However, if you can unpack the WARC, you can use any characterisation
tool to investigate the content of your WARC such as
[C3PO](http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-11-19-c3po-content-profiling-tool-preservation-analysis),
one of the Tika wrappers from SPRUCE, or roll your own using FITS or
Apache Tika stand-alone.

* peshkira: I just want to make sure, it is clear. c3po is not a characterisation
tool. It is a profiler tool that gives you an overview of the content
and allows you to analyse it a bit

how malsane could be the idea to characterize the content payload while
being downloaded?

sure it'll be a slow process, but using
[wget-lua](http://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Wget_with_Lua_hooks)
should not be difficult to write some rules to spawn an external process
(fits, jhove, whatever) and save back the result inside the warc.

the output should be saved under a resource record, with a namespace or
a selfdefined
[uri](http://archive-access.sourceforge.net/warc/warc_file_format-0.9.html#anchor22)

### Comments ###
* Peter Cliff: That would be quite neat. Doesn't WARC keep a log of mimetypes of files
grabbed? Would that be enough for a rough look?
* Andy Jackson: The MIME types in the usual WARC records are those declared by the
server. It's useful, but it's reliability is very variable.

Those 2 links to sbforge.org are not exactly up to date yet
(unfortunately).

The JHove2 WARC(/ARC/GZip) modules were part of a one year project
funded by the IIPC.

The WARC module which Andy linked to should be production ready. There
only remains the minor details of adding some unittests and merging with
the main JHove2 repository.

The latest binary is available from here
[https://bitbucket.org/nclarkekb/jhove2-iipc/downloads](https://bitbucket.org/nclarkekb/jhove2-iipc/downloads)

The following link should include some documentation on configuring
jhove2 with WARC on your system.
[https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/JHove2+modules+-+configuration](https://sbforge.org/display/NAS/JHove2+modules+-+configuration)

To be clear, the JHove2 WARC modules offer the characterization you are
looking for but only to the extent that there are JHove2 modules to
cover the formats. So JHove2 will identify and characterization your
WARC files and the content of your WARC files but only for the formats
which are supported.

Regards JWAT-Tools, those are more lightweight tools for validating only
the WARC(ARC/GZip) files but not their content. The payload is only
validated so far as to check digests and other headers which are present
in the WARC header.

If you have any other questions I will be happy to clarify the WARC work
I have done for the IIPC.
