How does the Library of Congress handle government publications?
=====================
I work in Inter-Library Loan at a university who uses the Library of
Congress classification system. A large part of my job is searching the
stacks for books, periodicals, and government publications to send to
various other institutions. I have found that when it comes to regular
books and periodicals, I have a good handle on how to find specific
things that I need.

However, when it comes to searching government publications, I find it
very difficult to find the specific volumes that I need. I know that it
starts out alphabetically, but beyond that I tend to get confused -
there are so many different permutations of letters and numbers that I
am never sure quite how it works.

Can someone explain in layman's terms how to break down the call numbers
to make for easier searching?

Some examples of the call numbers I see:

> CA2ON UG63 72P03
>
> CA1 XC1 89C043
>
> US1 Y 92I7A41

* Cynthia Baran: are you asking about LOC classification?
http://www.usg.edu/galileo/skills/unit03/libraries03\_04.phtml Or is it
actually a SuDoc number like this?

* Ashley Nunn: I am talking about LoC, which I am familiar with in the examples that
site uses (which are more of the books and journals I see), but
government publications seem to be a whole other kind of confusing...

It depends on which government's documents you mean. Waterloo seems to
be using CODOC, which McMaster explains very well here:
[http://library.mcmaster.ca/govpubs/guides/codoc](http://library.mcmaster.ca/govpubs/guides/codoc)

Since you asked about Library of Congress, I'm guessing you mean US
government documents. American libraries usually classify US government
documents using SUDOC call numbers, which Michigan State explains here:
[http://www.lib.msu.edu/branches/gov/sudocs-basics.jsp](http://www.lib.msu.edu/branches/gov/sudocs-basics.jsp)

However, if we're talking about how Waterloo does it, I note that
*Statistical Abstract of the United States* is catalogued as
`US1CN30 S55` in Waterloo's system. That's a CODOC number; you can tell
because it begins with "US". The American system assumes it's an
American publication. The SUDOC equivalent is `C 3.134/7:`, but it's
such a common reference book that many libraries using LC elsewhere also
use LC here, in which case it would be `HA202 S7`.

### Comments ###
* Ashley Nunn: Oh, that explains why I never understood - when I started they told me
everything was LoC, which made trying to find information on this very
difficult.
* Ben Ostrowsky: Yes, now that I see the example call numbers you gave, I'm certain those
are CODOC numbers.
