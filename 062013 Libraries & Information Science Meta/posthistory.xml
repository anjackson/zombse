Those experts may or may not have degrees—my coworker who has published a best-selling ALA publication and is invited to give talks on it is nevertheless not a librarian because she doesn't have an MLIS—and they may be degreed professionals in other fields who answer questions where our interests overlap. (For example, a First Amendment lawyer who provides expert-level legal information on censorship questions.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for which community that *is*—i.e., what's on-topic—we have agreed that it is the &quot;Libraries and Information Science&quot; community. We deliberately changed it from library science to libraries because we wanted to expand beyond the science of it to all exerts in any aspect of libraries. We likewise rejected the idea of restricting it to merely library management. More importantly to me, we acknowledged that the information science community vastly overlaps with the library science community to the point at which it was best to include them on our proposal, so information scientists who are *not* librarians and are *not* asking &quot;library questions&quot; are also welcome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is not a site for non-experts asking for explanations of basic concepts. However, this is a site for subject-matter experts who are not experts at teaching or explaining things asking other subject-matter experts how to teach or explain their subject of mutual interest. If a non-expert gets here from Google and finds the answer useful, that's nice, but they don't have to be involved in either asking or attempting to answer any such question. We shouldn't be deliberately obfuscating our questions or answers or, even worse, not asking the questions we need answered just to prevent outsiders from reading them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the same token, this is not a site for explaining to people who just bought their first book how to put it on a shelf. On the other hand, I personally know people with home libraries—frequently professional libraries—with thousands of items and a surprisingly high circulation rate. At some point the line between those people and people running a small public library has gotten blurred in certain respects, which is why you'll find questions tagged both [home-libraries] and [small-libraries]. We shouldn't be answering &quot;newbie&quot; questions, as stated above, but the fact that they're working with a non-public, non-school, non-college, non-university, non-corporate, non-subscription library does not mean that they aren't working with a library at all and can't have expert questions . . . especially when they're librarians who happen to have a massive personal library." />

Building a culture of accessibility to professionals and keeping the signal to noise ratio within acceptable limits goes a very long way towards the creation of a thriving community.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ServerFault has drawn a very clear line in the FAQ and elsewhere that *in the home* is explicitly off topic with rare exceptions. Such a policy would also work here, I believe. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a caveat to that, we've had several users with rather complex home installations (a lot of sysadmins have home labs more complex than some small office networks) ask very intelligent questions and it was only late into the process that it was revealed that this was a home lab not a workplace thing.

I'm a moderator and high rep user of ServerFault, one of StackExchange's other for-professional sites. We have quite a bit of experience in building a community for people-who-get-paid-for-this. We have learned that one of the better ways to handle this is to have a well-phrased 'NOT about' section in the [FAQ](http://serverfault.com/faq).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If LIS wants to be a site aimed at professionals or subject-matter experts, I believe we should find some language to go into the FAQ.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;The ServerFault NOT About section reads:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and it is *not* about…&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - **Anything in a home setting**&#xD;&#xA;   - Product, service, or learning material recommendations&#xD;&#xA;   - Career, salary, personnel, employment, or formal education&#xD;&#xA;   - Licensing, legal advice, and circumvention of security or policy&#xD;&#xA;   - Unauthorized hacking, password cracking, or system misuse&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;The first bullet-point is the work-horse. We've found that by scoping ServerFault as *in the workplace* we effectively exclude a lot of the interested amateurs. This is why it is bolded and the first point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second bullet-point is intended to do two things. First, discourage a certain kind of subjective question that can't be answered, and Second, discourage a type of question that attracts a lot of spam.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The third bullet-point is there because there is very little formalized education in the Systems Administration space, and what there is tends to be offered by vendors and is highly domain-specific. Indeed, it is *Too Localized*. I don't expect this to be a problem for LIS, as there are degree programs for it. However, career advice may still be too-subjective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other two points are specific to our subject matter and are the kind of too-localized or outright dangerous question we want to discourage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What kind of verbiage could we put into the LIS FAQ to discourage interested amateurs? [From the discussion we had][1], it sounds like *in the home* is not a viable limiter for LIS, so we need to come up with something.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We also need to figure out what, if anything, we plan on doing with career-advice type questions. These typically come from people just breaking into the field, and people looking to change career *paths*. Of the two, the former are far more common and in ServerFault's case is predominantly students fresh out of college looking for the *best* path to take to the career of their dreams; the rest are usually entry-level positions looking to advance. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.libraries.stackexchange.com/a/90/462" />

I think it would be better off not discussed on this site. The reason I say this is because anytime someone says &quot;You NEED an MLIS to work in the field&quot;, five more people come back saying either 1. &quot;I don't have one and I am the director/head librarian/whatever&quot; or 2. &quot;I work for people who don't have their degree.&quot; (The second being my situation.) In many cases, experience is valued just as equally as education.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Choosing to get your MLIS should be a personal decision because it is possible to move up in the library world without one -- maybe a little bit harder and a little longer road -- but there are tons of examples out there of successful professionals without their MLIS. It is a lot of debt and there aren't a ton of full-time, professional level job prospects out there. This is especially true of those who are switching careers and don't have the freedom to move to where there are jobs. The ALA has been telling us for a decade now that there is a &quot;graying of the profession&quot; and a &quot;mass retirement&quot; is just on the horizon but this is simply not happening due to the way the economy is these days." />

I think someone could go onto that thread right now, summarize the responses, (e.g. &quot;Well some people have done this, and some people have done this... and here is a note to consider...&quot;) then I would likely find that to be a &quot;best answer&quot; because that is the type of answer I was expecting when I asked the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/386/what-are-some-alternatives-to-fines-that-have-been-successfully-implemented" />

Of a certainty—common cataloging and metadata problems, for example, or some reference stumpers.

Complicated. Fuzzy. Not always susceptible to obvious or easily-evaluable solution.

That is, even if the question is one asked of a librarian and only answerable by crowd-sourcing our collective expert knowledge and wisdom, if it is not itself about LIS, it's not allowed. That's not a bad point; this is an LIS site. On the other hand, some questions really do require librarians to answer (&quot;name that book&quot; springs to mind), and as a site for experts to ask each other the kind of questions that need other experts to answer, I think that we could have a discussion about these questions. Personally, I'd rather try letting the wisdom of the crowd moderate bad questions than refuse an entire category without the experiment and suffer for it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a second line of attack that says that these questions will flood the site with non-expert questions if we let them in. I disagree. If we do get questions from non-experts that are best served on other sites, we can direct them there (and if that site is an SE site, questions can be moved directly), but if it's from an expert, I'm betting that they're not going to ask a question of us that it would be faster to find out on their own, especially if they've got a patron waiting on it. Even if it is by an expert but could be answered by a different community, we can still redirect them. As things currently stand, we get so few questions that redirecting a few in order to claim others that are relevant isn't going to tax us much; if that changes, we can re-visit the policy at that time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a third line of attack that readers' advisory is subjective, which I feel is slightly insulting to the people who do it and teach it; while it's not perfectly accurate, and therefore not 100% objective, if we couldn't actually predict readers' likely preferences in reality, there wouldn't be any reason to try or anything to teach about the subject, which just isn't true. This line of attack is simply untrue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I would rather try community moderation to select for good questions than ban entire categories up front, IFF we may be the best community to answer them.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On shopping questions:&#xD;&#xA;----------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The original blog post against shopping questions][1] was oriented around a tech recommendation that would be outdated in a year. The fact that such a small window of relevance made the question Too Localized was bolded to emphasize that it was the real sticking point with the question. For comparison, RPG.SE decided things the other way, I'm guessing in part because even an old edition of an RPG isn't necessarily superseded by later editions for all purposes and in any case the product cycle for a specific product line may be five years, ten years, twenty years, or even infinitely long (i.e., there's only one edition ever). Given that context, it's no wonder that they bucked the trend. What's the situation with library shopping questions? I don't know. It might depend on the question; the ebooks situation is evolving full-steam, but I don't know that that's true for all possible examples.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other point about shopping questions that was made in the original blog post was they they wanted the answer to be a universal learning experience by discussing what criteria made a good X rather than which products met that criteria at any given time. However, the similar questions that I've asked here have been ones for which I knew which criteria were good ahead of time, I just had no way of researching possible answers that might meet those criteria without crowd-sourcing possibilities. In the engineering and technology world, it's quite possible that asking people what my standard should be is an objective question because mechanical operations have relatively deterministic results, but asking such a question in LIS is easily to open a can of worms you could fill entire journals with (and people frequently do). Similarly, the specs for a wide range of tech items are a quick Google search away and all I need is a filter, whereas I might know what I want for a library item but can't actually find a list of such products anywhere online, much less detailed descriptions of them. Thus, what aspect of the shopping question needs a crowd-sourced answer is very different for us than for the sites that blog post was written about.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**I would support shopping questions where the questioner can identify a reasonably objective standard for what they need and the answers are unlikely to change significantly in the next several years (as determined by the wisdom of the crowd using Close —&gt; Too Localized votes).**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On polls, best practices, and subjectivity:&#xD;&#xA;-------------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As has been stated, we are not in a discipline with a lot of provably correct answers, at least outside of some technical areas (physical questions such as book preservation, many information science questions, &amp;c.). We ARE in a discipline in which &quot;How we done it good&quot; (as one of my professors put it) is a valid and common type of professional journal or magazine article. In short, we are in a discipline in which polling the community for how they have tackled a problem, discussing the answers, and then collectively selecting one or more of the answers as &quot;best&quot; is how we arrive at canonical best practices. In SE terms, these steps are called &quot;asking a question,&quot; &quot;answering a question,&quot; &quot;comments,&quot; &quot;voting on answers,&quot; and &quot;accepting a best answer.&quot; They're also called &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;non-constructive.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Libraries.SE is in a position to not just report canonical answers that everyone already knows and agrees on but to discover for the first time what the canonical answers *are*. That is, I think, something that we should embrace. No, we can't write a bright line rule for determining in advance which questions are going to discover a consensus best answer, because we won't know if there's one to discover until the question has been asked and people have started talking about it. Yes, this might be seen as subjective and non-constructive by the standards written for sites where &quot;Does it compile?&quot; is a reasonable test for whether something is a valid answer (whether or not it's correct). However, it's how things work in this discipline and it's constructive in the best possible sense: it can discover hidden knowledge and construct a database of it. Isn't that what we're trying to do here? If SE does not want to support that form of inquiry, SE does not want to support an LIS site, and we need to know that now so that we can go elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**If a question just wants to know &quot;How do YOU do things?&quot; it's a bad question, but if it wants to know &quot;What's a good way of doing X?&quot; it can be constructive if there's some obvious goal that the answers have to be working towards (i.e., a standard by which to measure an emergent best practice).**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/" />

A lot of what people seem to want to know revolves around how different libraries do things, which is fantastic and yay, but is also (generally) more suited to a forum setting than a Q and A setting. Some of the things that make it different from a forum are the idea that we want answers to be suitable to a general audience, not just the very specific needs of one poster, and we are also not really open to extended discussions and people’s opinions on things (unless they have fact to back them). There is a stronger focus on actually solving problems rather than just having open ended discussions on the topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[I have written about this idea before](http://meta.libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/2/how-do-we-want-to-handle-subjective-questions) and maybe revisiting some of the answers there might help make this clearer. &#xD;&#xA;[Robert’s answer](http://meta.libraries.stackexchange.com/a/5/22) talks about how &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;the anecdotal style question you mentioned — one that seeks to poll the community — is where you tend to run into the most problems. What is your favorite [X]? What does your library do about [X]? Even if the the answers are not literally one-liners, those types of questions generally do not make great questions for this type of Q&amp;A.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is precisely what we are running into. Generally, these sorts of questions are awesome in a forum or a relaxed getting to know you type setting, but here, where we want to be able to accept answers and such to questions, it becomes impossible - how can I upvote one library's way of doing things over another? Just because they are different, can I say one is inherently better than the other?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the [blog post Robert mentions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/real-questions-have-answers/) - &quot;real questions have answers, not items or ideas or opinions.&quot; If your question is more of a collection of ideas or opinions, it's not going to work well in this format. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stack Exchange and this sort of model isn’t for everyone, and it isn’t always suited to everything people want to ask, because of the nature of how things work.

I am beginning to agree with @M. Alan Thomas II that this site is just not a good fit for librarians.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Librarians are unlike any other group on StackExchange. First, we don't need canonical answers because we can find those on our own. Second, we appreciate that a good library is full of information, sometimes contradictory, and as librarians we would rather see an assortment of answers and choose the best for ourselves than see a bunch of questions for which some other person identified what is the true and accepted answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Third, and perhaps most significant, we have all been educated at the feet of Ranganathan - every book its user, every user his book. Librarians don't care that the answer to a question is only useful to a few people, or even one person. That person has an information need; we try to meet it. If we have room for it in our collection (and web-space is pretty limitless), we should make it available. As it stands, we have a paltry 276 questions here - room is clearly not an issue. If we open up the site to a wider variety of question types, we might have a site that is useful to librarians. What if it blossomed and we had thousands of questions to sort through - how would people find the information that is helpful? We are librarians - we might have to develop a better system of tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And fourth, a related point, the process of closing questions and asking people to make the questions better before they are worthy of answering is insulting, and it drives people away. As librarians, we should instead be asking the questioner clarifying questions to improve the question if the question is not clear. If it is clear but perhaps not within preset guidelines, consider just letting it stand to see whether it gets answers that might be helpful to someone. Over time, the &quot;library&quot; can be weeded of questions that never got upticked answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So those are my suggestions." />

Personally, I think the main issue with a Q&amp;A site for librarians is that we are all researchers by training, so there just isn't a burning need. A future site might attempt to recruit membership among library school students, who are still learning and need answers that are based not only on research but also on experience." />

Join Area 51 and make a new/better proposal, or find another site on SE that you can enjoy and give your passion to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, but definitely not least, I want to thank Ashley for being a fantastic co-mod.  We faced some difficult decisions all along about scope, and we addressed them well.  It was a fun ride, and I'm sad that it's over (for now).  Would I mod with you again? YBYA, IAHB." />
