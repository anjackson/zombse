Are questions about specific reference managers for end users appropriate?
=====================
There have been several questions similar to
[http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/989/zotero-do-not-get-language-field-of-article-in-coins-citations](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/989/zotero-do-not-get-language-field-of-article-in-coins-citations)
which are inquiries about reference manager-specific issues. I'd like to
get some input from the community as to whether these are seeking
information that is pertinent for professional librarians.

Are these too oriented towards the "end user" to be on-topic?
