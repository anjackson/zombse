Do we really need the 'best-practices' tag?
=====================
Aren't most questions already asking 'What is the best way to do X?'

What does this tag achieve?

No, those types of tags should be avoided. Think of it this way â€”

It's not likely the question is actually *about* the subject of "best
practices." Tags are supposed to tell you what the question is about
(the subject of the question). Tags are **not** supposed to be used to
describe *why* the question was asked, or similar types of
meta-categorization.

So tags like [beginner] and [best-practices] and [subjective] are to be
avoided.
