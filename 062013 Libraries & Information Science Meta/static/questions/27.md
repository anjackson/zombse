"Best practice" response to multiple good answers?
=====================
Since I can only vote for 1 as answer, is commenting on all good answers
with thanks considered filling the site with chatter?

I'd recommend waiting a day to come back to the answers you'd like to
vote. You can also cancel votes by clicking on the upvote or downvote
button again.

Remember, marking a question as the accepted answer is not the same as
voting on answers, you can only mark one answer as accepted and this can
be cancelled or changed any time unlike voting which can get 'locked in'
after a certain amount of time.

Unless you have something valuable you can contribute to the answer it's
best not to comment. But it's acceptable to thank somebody in a comment
*in addition to* making a point (even if that's nothing more than
explaining *how* you found the answer useful).
