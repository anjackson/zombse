How has this site been promoted at ALA conference or other meetings?
=====================
Has libraries.stackexchange been actively promoted at the recent ALA
conference or have we lost a good opportunity to [spread the
word](http://meta.libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/45/how-do-we-spread-the-word-about-our-awesome-site)
The [next ALA meeting](http://www.ala.org/conferencesevents/upcoming) is
in January but sure there are other meetings as well. We don't have
flyer or something like that, do we? There are [some blog
articles](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=libraries+stackexchange&tbm=blg)
but no announcements in journals and newsletters, are there?

I suspect nothing has really been done yet because we are a relatively
new and shiny site.

If you want to get the word out (which is totally awesome!) feel free to
do so! Write to the people who put announcements and stuff in journals
and newsletters! Make Libraries.SE sound as awesome and useful as we all
know it can be, and get the word out.

It is probably going to be a while before word gets out on its own,
since we haven't been around that long. But if we all work to get the
word out in our own ways (within our own communities, or wider, whatever
you can do is awesome), then eventually, it will (hopefully) begin to
snowball on its own.

We don't have a flyer or anything pre-made, but as long as you follow
the guidelines [here](http://stackexchange.com/legal/trademark-guidance)
in regards to trademarks and the like, there is no reason why you can't
make your own. If you do, please share it on meta - that way others can
share in helping make the flyers (and anything else you come up with)
represent Libraries in the most awesome way possible.

* Jakob: Thank's for the pointer. I just asked whether there is [material to
promote other
sites](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/137884/is-there-information-material-to-promote-specific-stack-exchange-sites)
which we could build on.

[ASIS&T is coming up next month](http://www.asis.org/asist2012/) ... and
they generally have a message board that people can post stuff to ...
but I'm not so great at writing copy. If someone else wants to make a
sign or something, I can post it.
