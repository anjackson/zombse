Should the [archive] tag be changed and synonym'd to [archives]?
=====================
Most of our tags use the plural for things like institutions. (E.g.,
[public-libraries](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/public-libraries "show questions tagged 'public-libraries'").)
Should
[archive](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archive "show questions tagged 'archive'")
be renamed
[archives](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archives "show questions tagged 'archives'")
to maintain consistency and avoid confusion? If so, should it be made a
synonym of
[archives](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archives "show questions tagged 'archives'")?

I believe that, yes, this needs to happen; although there is no current
splintering in the tag base, the SE system restricts creating [archives]
when [archive] exists. (In the cases of libraries/library, it apparently
is unaware of the nonstandard plural, allowing both tags to exist.)
However, pluralization in our institutional classification tags is
standard here. Furthermore, as there is already usage of the [archive]
tag, a synonym will help the community adjust.

I merged
[archive](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archive "show questions tagged 'archive'")
into
[archives](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archives "show questions tagged 'archives'")
and set up a synonym, so future attempts to use
[archive](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/archive "show questions tagged 'archive'")
will be automatically converted to the plural form.

'Archive' is a potentially problematic term as it might be a few things:

-   a noun, referring to a place where things are stored
-   a noun, referring to the organization that stores things
-   a verb, referring to the process of storing things

I'd personally be inclined to add both 'archives' and 'archiving', as
there are aspects of archiving that happen in locations other than
formal archives ... but we'd have to see how it gets used first. Looking
at those that are currently flagged as 'archives', [only
one](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/209/) stands out as
it's *really* not about the topic of archives. Those looking for an
archive of a specific type of content may not be either.
