Research data tag pileup
=====================
We've got a bit of a tag pileup happening around research data. Last I
checked, we've got

-   research-data
-   data-management
-   data-curation
-   research-support

Synonyms, tag deletions, preferred term?

dsalo

Answer by Jakob
----------------
No synonyms.
[research-data](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/research-data "show questions tagged 'research-data'")
is better related to data as collected digital objects.
[data-management](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-management "show questions tagged 'data-management'")
is too general and should be avoided.
[data-curation](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/data-curation "show questions tagged 'data-curation'")
sounds more like long term archiving.
[research-support](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/research-support "show questions tagged 'research-support'")
is also broader than support of research via dealing with research data.

* dsalo: Modern data curation actually takes a whole-lifecycle approach to data
management; long-term archiving is only one part of it. Perhaps merge it
with data-management, then?
* Jakob: yep, data-curation should be data-management or the other way round.
* dsalo: coolio. I don't have sufficient privs yet; can somebody else take care
of it?
