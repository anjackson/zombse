to the main site.*

I have to do a presentation in my university, I chose to do a
presentation and a write a paper about minimalism and minimalist
lifestyle.

I need some books, in french and english, my paper is written in french
but i can translate quotes from english books.

i found some english books on amazon, but couldn't find any french book.
Is there any book about minimalism vs consumerism, or the minimalist
lifestyle? (French or English, the more books i find, the more
references i have).

Unfortunately this question is not on topic here - we deal with the
professional side of Libraries, and are not a service for finding books
on a particular topic.

I would suggest trying your local library - the people at the reference
desk might be able to help you, or just searching their catalogue might
lead to some results.
