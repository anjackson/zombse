Where's the question about civil disobedience?
=====================
There was recently posted a question to the topic of civil disobedience.
Was this question removed by the person who asked the question or by the
moderators here?

----------------
The community deemed it non-constructive (within the purpose of the
site) due to having no clear, factually correct answer and downvoted it;
at that point, removal by the person who asked the question was merely
an acknowledgement of the error in advance of moderation, but one or the
other was almost certainly going to happen.

When I follow a link to the question (from my flag history), I get the
following message:

> This question was voluntarily removed by its author.
