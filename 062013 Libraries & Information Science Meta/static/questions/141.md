Questions from cycling for libraries
=====================
Today the second [cycling for
libraries](http://www.cyclingforlibraries.org/), a kind of unconference
for librarians on bikes has started. During the trip, each participant
engages in answers to a library-related question as "homework". Maybe we
can get some of these interesting questions also **[asked and answered
at libraries.SE](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/ask)**?

I looked on the site and didn't see any particular copyright
information, but I'm assuming as long as you cite your question as
"based on " you should be okay. Ideally, you should observe the *topics*
and flesh out their one line questions with more details or specific
parameters.

Of course, be mindful that some of their questions/topics are not
constructive or are too localized, etc.

Finally, choose maybe a handful that you are truly interested in (or per
person, if multiple users decide to go with this idea), as trying to ask
too many will likely decrease the quality of the individual questions.
