Chat room name suggestions
=====================
We've reached an all-too-critical stage in our development here on Stack
Exchange. Our chatroom name is boring and we should change that!

Realizing, this would be a minor change, but I think it would provide us
some "team spirit" and hopefully make people aware of the chatroom and
maybe prompt some folks to jump in and start using it. Chat topics
should be made up of some percentage of site and LIS related discourse,
but can certainly include a healthy dose of just shooting the breeze and
playing "current events" :)

So, if you have a clever (semi-professional, non-offensive) name you'd
like to nominate, go ahead and **leave an answer on this question**, and
we'll use the voting to come up with a name everyone likes. Please do
not be hurt if someone downvotes your name, it just means that they
disagree with it, not that it's bad!

(It's Dewey for social networking - Communication through digital
media))

* jonsca: Very clever, Mary Jo!
* Jakob: Too obscure because Dewey is not that familiar enough to everyone.
* jonsca: @Jakob I see your point, but keep in mind that many of the chatroom
names are inside jokes, hehe.
* Jeni: Could we use both the LC and Dewey number for social networking as a
name? It's still boring & seems underused
