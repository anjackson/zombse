Questions on software recommendations not allowed?
=====================
I was startled to learn that requests for software recommendations are
disallowed, even if they're pertinent to libraries. This seems very
strange to me, but I'm new to this forum and perhaps there's a reason.
Could someone explain the reasoning behind it? Saying it's a "shopping
question" only begs the question.

This is in reference to the closing of the question "How to view MARC
files in a human readable way?"

Update: I see that this question is part of what's discussed under "How
closely does the LIS Stack Exchange need to follow other Stack Exchanges
in terms of 'appropriate' questions?" It doesn't look as if I can
withdraw a question, but perhaps discussion should remain there instead.

* jonsca: You don't have to withdraw your question, but yes, all of these ideas
are tied together.
