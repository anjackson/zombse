Let's get critical: May 2013 Site Self-Evaluation
=====================
We all love [Libraries & Information Science Stack
Exchange](http://libraries.stackexchange.com), but there is a whole
world of people out there who need answers to their questions and don't
even know that this site exists. When they arrive from Google, what will
their first impression be? Let's try to look at this site through the
eyes of someone who's never seen it before, and see how we stack up
against the rest of the 'Net.

The [Site Self-Evaluation review
queue](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/review/site-eval) is open and
populated with 10 questions that were asked and answered in the last
quarter. Run a few Google searches to see how easy they are to find and
compare the answers we have with the information available on other
sites.

Rating the questions is only a part of the puzzle, though. Do you see a
pattern of questions that should have been closed but are not? Questions
or answers that could use an edit? Anything that's going really well?
**Post an answer below to share your thoughts** and discuss these
questions and the site's health with your fellow users!
