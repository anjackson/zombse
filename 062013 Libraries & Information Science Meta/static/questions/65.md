Should [public-library] and similar be made synonyms of their plurals (e.g., [public-libraries])?
=====================
As of this writing,
[public-libraries](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/public-libraries "show questions tagged 'public-libraries'")
has 12 questions and
[public-library](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/public-library "show questions tagged 'public-library'")
has 2. Obviously these are intended to be the same category, and plurals
appear to be the order of the day, so I've submitted retagging edits for
the two
[public-library](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/public-library "show questions tagged 'public-library'")
questions. However, this may not be sufficient to indicate a need for a
synonym.

----------------
I believe that this does indicate a need for a synonym, as clearly we
are experiencing splintering in the tag structure and single-to-plural
conversion is intuitive and noncontroversial.

* M. Alan Thomas II: Deleted (empty) tags cannot be synonym'd. This can be revisited if the
issue arises in the future.
