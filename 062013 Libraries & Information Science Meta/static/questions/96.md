[research]: What should be done?
=====================
The
[research](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/research "show questions tagged 'research'")
tag appears to have several different question topics its being used
for, and I can't think of an obvious definition that would allow us to
declare some usage right and some wrong. So: ignore / retag / delete?

----------------
I'd say there's at least two concepts there :

**research-support** : libraries supporting people doing research

**LIS-research** : doing research about libraries & LIS.
