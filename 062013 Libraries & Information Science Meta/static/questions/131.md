Moderator Pro Tem Announcement
=====================
Throughout the beta, we need members from the site whose focus is to
engage the community, both in community-building issues and site
management. That's why we select a few members from each community to
act as temporary, provisional Moderators. You can read about the program
here: [**Moderators Pro
Tempore**](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/).

A bit delayed since their instatement, but I am pleased to announce that
these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to
help us assure that each community's issues are properly addressed.

We want to make this site a huge success, and these members are great
examples of exactly the type of people we need to make this site
succeed. Please welcome them for the hard work and time they contribute.

### Did I overlook anyone?

Almost certainly. There are members who are actively involved and very
deserving of recognition. My failure to account for everyone this early
on is in *no way* a slight against them. Ideally, Moderators are elected
by the community and that's why **you'll have your elections after your
site makes it through graduation.**

Most of all, be respectful and understanding of the Moderators Pro Tem.
Members of your community are volunteering their time and learning on
the job. It's a learning experience for everyone.
