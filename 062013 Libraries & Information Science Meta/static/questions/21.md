Are youth services questions on topic?
=====================
For example:

Into what age groups is it most effective to divide storytimes?

How might one best use Facebook as a tool with one's teen councilors,
volunteers or patrons? (And I have plenty of subdividing questions, such
as Do you allow teens to moderate any aspect of your Facebook presence;
and, Do you address the fact that Facebook requires users to be 13 or
older?)

I would think that, being a legitimate concern for libraries, that
questions like this would be on topic.

I hope so! I'm a Youth Librarian!

Youth Librarianship is part of "Library and Information Science" so
topics regarding it should be considered on topic.

* Debrarian: I was thinking so too! But hadn't seen any in that vein, so just wanted
to double-check. Splendid! I'll post some! Thx!
* Melissa: I hope so, too! I am an academic librarian whose university is
establishing a teaching licensure program, so I'm developing an
expertise on children's and YA literature as I go ...
