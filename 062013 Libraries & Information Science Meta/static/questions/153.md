Extracting linked data thesaurus structure from tag wikis
=====================
Some may have noticed my edits to tag wikis where I added links to
Wikipedia, E-LIS, GND etc.) and links between tags, prefixed with arrows
(↓/↑). I [wrote a set of scripts](https://github.com/nichtich/se2skos)
to extract tag wikis from StackExchange and create

-   an SKOS/RDF concept scheme of [tags at
    libraries.stackexchange](https://github.com/nichtich/se2skos/blob/master/data/libraries/tags-as-skos.ttl)
    (in RDF/Turtle).
-   a graphica
    href="https://github.com/nichtich/se2skos/blob/master/data/libraries/tag-graph.svg"
    rel="nofollow"\>visualization of links between tags (as SVG with
    hyperlinks).

This is how a tag graph looks like:

I would not, however, create tag wikis for tags will less than two
questions. We should not create a top-down thesaurus of tags but let the
vocabulary evolve with the questions.

P.S: I have since published the paper and given a presentation:

Systems**. In *Proceedings of the 6th Conference on Metadata and
Semantics Research* (MTSR '12). Springer, pages 89-97.

### Comments ###
* jonsca: Wow, that's awesome! What programs can import those data files?
* Jakob: That fully depends on the use case and I can also create other formats.
I have written [a paper
draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xxgOcAASsZ4X1b3FXuQ835roWCNeiEOPyxedlQIMciM/edit)
that mentions use cases (feel free to comment on it!): information
retrieval, discovery of related resources and scientometric analysis.
