Are questions like "What is your most used feature in an ILS" on-topic?
=====================
Just to frame this question a bit: I'm a software developer who recently
started working in a university library and I have a lot of questions
regarding the regular workflows in a library.

Now I image a lot of this questions would be *(very) subjective*, for
example:

1.  What is your most used feature, when working with metadata in an
    ILS?
2.  What feature you miss most from your ILS, when working with
    metadata?
3.  What innovative library websites do you know, and what feature do
    you find well executed there?
4.  Free bibliographic metadata sources (links, sites)?

and so on.

Questions 1. and 2. would help me to get a picture of typical
requirements, especially concerning metadata. I talk about that with my
colleagues, but to hear more *opinions* would be great.

Question 3. looks too broad to me, although I admit, I'd love to get
answers from library professionals (as opposed to say visitors or
software developers).

Question 4. could maybe the most on topic.

Would the questions above be suitable for this site?

The way first two are worded is way too subjective. I would suggest
talking directly to the librarians you are working with. You'll get a
better idea of their specific needs.

One way to worst could be "In a university library setting, what is an
effective method of seeking out metadata?" or "are there any known and
proven methods of seeking out metadata using [insert ILS] here?"

Question four is simply a list question and those are also off topic in
the SE world.

* miku: Thanks! I see - I'll have to be more specific in my questions, which I
guess is just a bit harder, if one is new to a field.
* KatieR: I can understand that & it is appreciated that you ask in meta first to
hammer out exactly what is on topic. Even if you wanted to ask "What
resources are considered high quality regarding [insert topic here]".
Just make sure you mention what kind of library you're working in when
asking questions, otherwise you'll get comments about it being "too
broad" since there are so many different kinds of libraries.
