Are questions on taxonomies/hierarchies on topic?
=====================
I am beginning to get involved in creating taxonomies for our
organisation that go beyond the simple three-layer product hierarchies
that I've been dealing with until now. Is this an appropriate forum to
ask questions about such things?

Answer by Ashley Nunn
----------------
We have had a few questions already on the topic of taxonomy and
hierarchies, such as [Reference on document
types](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/q/334/22), for example. As
long as they follow the Stack Exchange conventions on what makes a good
quality question (see the [FAQ](http://libraries.stackexchange.com/faq)
for more information), I don't see why they can't at least be considered
for inclusion.

Feel free to ask questions as you have them!
