Is the PDF format appropriate for preserving documents with long perspective?
=====================
PDF is almost a de facto standard when it comes to exchanging documents.
One of the best things is that always, on each machine, the page numbers
stay the same, so it can be easily cited in academic publications etc.

But de facto standard is also opening PDFs with Acrobat Reader. So the
single company is making it all functioning fluently.

However, thinking in longer perspective, say 50 years, is it a good idea
to store documents as PDFs? Is the PDF format documented good enough to
ensure that after 50 years it will be relatively easy to write software
that will read such documents, taking into account that PDF may be then
completely deprecated and no longer supported?
