Microscopy, journals and compression
=====================
I work in data management for an electron microscopy centre. One of the
things I hear "from people" is that Journals in the field do not like
data compression. The most extreme version I've heard is that some
Journals insist that images not be compressed at all ... ever.
Apparently, no distinction between lossy and lossless compression. (Or
at least that's what I was told.)

Is there any truth in this?

I've seen Journal instructions that say that images should be captured
and stored without lossy compression ... which is fair enough. But what
about lossless compression?

(Obviously, it is nonsensical from a technical perspective to blanket
ban all lossless compression ...)

* mjuarez: Are there any examples of which type of compression are allowed? This
seems like a requirement put in a by a non-technical editor.
