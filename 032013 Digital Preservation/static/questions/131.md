If my computer plays music that's really loud, could that make my computer's hard drives accumulate bad sectors faster, or maybe fail faster?
=====================
Perhaps because louder speakers tend to induce larger vibrations that
could have an affect on the hard disk head?

Alternatively, can putting an external speaker next to an external hard
drive possibly reduce the lifespan of the hard drive?
