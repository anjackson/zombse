Which tools are most effective for identifying the format of ebook (mobi, epub) files?
=====================
Which tools are you using for identification of **epub** or **mobi**
formats?

For my private library I save every book I've bought (either epub or
mobi), removing drm. I would keep also detailed metadata about these
files.

[Fido](https://github.com/openplanets/fido), the tool I prefer, has some
[issues](https://github.com/openplanets/fido/issues/32). Either jhove or
fits are recognizing these files as bitstreams only. The only working
tool seems to be
[epubcheck](https://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/wiki/Extraction), but
only for epub files.

* mopennock: Are you asking about tools for identification or preferred formats for
preservation? Please refine your question and try to avoid chatty, open
ended queries (i.e. which tools are you using for...). Tnx.
* Paul Wheatley: Agree with Mo. This has the core of a very useful question for this
community, but it needs tightening up a little, and needs a really
meaningful and pithy question title
* Andy Jackson: I recommend leaving this ad the identification question and moving the
rest into other questions. I responded to the ID part below.

During [last year's file format ID
hack](http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/CURATEcamp_24_hour_worldwide_file_id_hackathon_Nov_16_2012),
the [British Library
team](http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-11-19-identifying-ebooks-file-id-hackathon)
came up with some Apache Tika signatures for some eBook formats (you can
find them in [this magic
file](https://github.com/openplanets/format-corpus/blob/master/tools/fidget/src/main/resources/org/apache/tika/mime/custom-mimetypes.xml)).
Although set up on Tika, these should be easy to port to Fido.

I tend to use the command line. All modern computers except for those
running Windows have the `file` tool which can be used like this:

    $ file *.epub *.mobi
    Natural Language Processing with Python - Steven Bird.epub: EPUB ebook data
    pg8086.mobi:                                                Mobipocket E-book "Down_and_Out-_Magic_Kingdom"

Here, I used `file` to identify the format of all files that have the
`.epub` or `.mobi` file extension, but I could have used the asterisk
alone to identify all non-hidden files in the current directory. So in
this little experiment, `file` successfully identified the two e-book
formats, and for the mobi(pocket) format, it was able to extract the
title (or a short form of it).
