=====================
Vintage computing or retrocomputing is the use of older computer
hardware and software in modern times. Retrocomputing is usually classed
as a hobby and recreation rather than a practical application of
technology. Enthusiasts often collect rare and valuable hardware and
software for sentimental reasons.

Retrocomputing can also have a valuable application in the field of
digital preservation and allow the possibilty to archive media from an
obsolete format that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to
retrieve with more modern equipment.
