Most efficient way to generate and validate file checksums
=====================
I'd like to be able to capture and validate checksums for large-scale
collections of files, typically nested within a complex directory
hierarchy. Does every single file need a checksum? Are there ways to
leverage the existing directory structure to, say, validate only a node
in the file tree and not necessarily every file within?

I realize this is in part a computer science question but I'm hoping
those with digital preservation expertise might have encountered a
similar challenge.

* Andy Jackson: As the answers note, it's important to distinguish the types of threat
you are mitigating and checksum accordingly. [A previous Library and

be of interest, although it's mostly about HDFS.
