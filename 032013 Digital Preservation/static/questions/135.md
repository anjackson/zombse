What should I look for when finding an external HD that maximizes its expected lifetime as a stable carrier medium?
=====================
Cost is definitely a factor, and I would be willing to sacrifice some
durability for cost (if a slight increase in durability results in a
significant increase in cost).

* Ben Fino-Radin: Please be more specific: what do you mean by \*durability\*? Do you mean
the physical durability of the drive's enclosure, or do you mean the
potential longevity of the hard drive itself as a stable carrier medium?
* InquilineKea: Okay just updated.
* wizzard0: From this and other questions it is still not clear what you're trying
to do. What you can do is describe the system completely, especially the
GOALS that it needs to satisfy, otherwise it is very hard to come up
with a concrete answer.
