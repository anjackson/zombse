Do electronic devices, hard drives, and laptops fail faster in highly-polluted environments?
=====================
Highly-polluted environments (especially ones with nanoparticles) could
have more dust contamination, which could increase the amount of tiny
dust that accumulates inside hard drives.

Answer by wizzard0
----------------
1.  Hard drives have dust filters and generally not collect any dust
    inside.
2.  Dust kills fans and therefore laptops
3.  "electronic devices" fear conductive dust and overheating, so in
    general dust is bad. But it is not usually the main source of
    failure.
