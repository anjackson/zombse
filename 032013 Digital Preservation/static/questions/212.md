How to deal with preservation of software with unknown author and licence?
=====================
Some even very old educational software is still of value today and it
is worth preserving.

The problem is that nowadays the licence rights are very important
topic, but 20 or 30 years ago it was not considered important for many
programmers, who have made such software peaces, don't placing any
licence or even their names. But how can you tell if such program, found
in some archive in school workshop was intentionally made without
credits, or such credits were removed by someone?

Can the archiving such software for preservation theoretically and
practically violate someone's intellectual or material rights? Note that
such software is to be considered coming from unknown source, because no
one is going no to tell, where such program come from, and who have
copied them? It may be some student's work or pirated software of some
company who doesn't exist anymore.

* gmcgath: This is an example of what's known in the general case as "orphan
works," works that may be in copyright but to which there are no known
claims. It's a problem that big institutions have wrestled with, without
much success.
