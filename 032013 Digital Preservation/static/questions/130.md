What is the safest place to store an external hard drive?
=====================
Ideally I'd like to back everything up to a cloud. But my Internet
connection probably isn't fast enough to back everything up so I'd still
like a secure place to store them.

I would also like to guard against all low-probability events, such as
table collapses, floods, earthquakes, window-shattering meteors, and me
accidentally stepping on my old hard drives.

### Comments ###
* John Lovejoy: backups are not a means of digital preservation
* Michael Kj√∂rling: This question is about general computer support, and probably fits
better over on [SuperUser](http://superuser.com/).
* wizzard0: You are asking a wrong question for many reasons: 1. it's not about DP
2. HDs fail anyway, it's not like you can help much with this 3. what is
the expected budget? how many HDs? how do you store them currently? etc
etc etc.
* Donald.McLean: Is your connection really that slow relative to the amount of data that
you want to back up? It took me a couple of months for my initial backup
to the service that I use but maintaining the backup is nothing. Also,
some companies, such as CrashPlan, offer seeding services. You pay a fee
and they mail you a physical disk that you back everything up to and
mail back to them.
