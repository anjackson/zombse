File format migration paths for Instant Artist files
=====================
[*Instant Artist*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Print_Artist) is
an abandonware layout and publishing platform from the early 90s by
Pixellite Group and Autodesk.

Its file formats include `.sgn` (signs), `.ban` (banners), `.gc`
(greeting cards), `.bc` (business cards), `.lth` (letterheads), etc.
They don't appear to open in contemporary software. I'd rather not
emulate if I can avoid it. What are these files' possible file format
migration paths, or are they proprietary and unable to be converted?
