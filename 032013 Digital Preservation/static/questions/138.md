How can I archive all the data in an RSS feed?
=====================
I know that Google Reader often archives all of the items in a RSS feed,
which for example allows me to access the RSS feeds of blogs that no
longer exist. How can I mass-export the content of those feeds onto a
local disk?

* Ben Fino-Radin: When asking a technical question, provide examples, or links to the
content you are talking about so that answers may provide informed,
accurate, and actionable steps.
* gmcgath: Your question implies you're committed to using Google Reader. Why? If
you want to set up archiving of feeds, it would seem easier to use a
standalone RSS reader with an export capability.

Have you tried Google's [Data Liberation For Google
Reader](http://www.dataliberation.org/google/reader)?

[**newsbeuter**](http://www.newsbeuter.org/) was an awesome news reader
(i'm not using it anymore).\
 it can sync with [google
reader](http://www.newsbeuter.org/doc/newsbeuter.html#_google_reader_support)
and save all the contents of feeds in a local sqlite database.

if you are looking for a gui tool **NetNewswire** for osx also can sync
with google reader and maintain an [html
archive](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/help/3.2/en/htmlArchive.html)
of posts
