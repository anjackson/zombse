How can I archive all the Facebook discussions on a Facebook group page?
=====================
It used to be do-able with DownThemAll (back before Facebook went all
crazy on Ajax). Now it's impossible.

[ArchiveFacebook](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/archivefacebook/)
is a Firefox plugin that was developed by the [Old Dominion University
Web Science and Digital Libraries Research
Group](http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/). While I think it doesn't archive
groups yet, the sense I get is that it could be adapted to do so.

Facebook offers an "archive" function from Settings \> Account Settings
\> Download a Copy of Your Facebook Data. I've never started a group on
Facebook. Perhaps if it is a group you started it is available for
download?
