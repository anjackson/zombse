What hardware consumer devices exists for digital preservation?
=====================
I collect computers and old games. What hardware consumer affordable
devices exists in the market for preserving floppy and tapemedia? I know
of the Kryoflux, which can preserve certain floppydisks, but what more
exists?

### Comments ###
* Nick Krabbenhoeft: Can you narrow down what kind of media you're asking about? There are
too many dead media formats for anyone to give you a satisfying answer.
* gmcgath: By "preserving media," do you mean allowing access to and export from
old devices (as with the Kryoflux and floppies)? My first thought was
that you were asking about storage devices, but from your example I'm
guessing not.
* Bill Lefurgy: There's also a risk factor here. The most careful preservation method
would involve Kryoflux, etc., but it's debatable whether that gear is
consumer affordable.
* Beamie: Edited the question to only regard floppy and tapemedia. If kryoflux
doesn't count as consumer affordable, i don't know what alternatives
that would.
