Studies on media failure rates
=====================
Everybody here is talking about storage failures in one way or another.

What these discussions miss is **solid, objective data** on media
failure rates.

I'll start with the [Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive
Population](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en//archive/disk_failures.pdf)
article from Google, and [Disk failures in the real
world](http://static.usenix.org/events/fast07/tech/schroeder/schroeder.pdf)
from CMU. See also the less scientific [Is Your SSD More Reliable Than A
Hard
Drive?](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ssd-reliability-failure-rate,2923.html)
article for Tom's hardware.

Please contribute! Links to studies on tape and DVD/Bluray media are
especially welcome.

### Comments ###
* gmcgath: I can't figure out what your question is. This is an area for asking
questions, not a general discussion forum.
* Robert Cartaino: This is a great question, but for reasons that are not immediately
obvious, I'm going to have to close this as unusually broad. We're here
to provide answers to questions about digital preservation, not
questions about where to find things on the Internet. See [more on this
here](http://meta.digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/q/27/101) â€” we
want to have answers, not links to answers, on Stack Exchange.
* lechlukasz: The title would also have to be changed, I've understand it as how many
students are failing on media faculty...
