When does it make sense to use different web archiving tools?
=====================
In particular, I'm thinking about
[Archive-it](http://www.archive-it.org/),
[HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/),
[Heritrix](https://webarchive.jira.com/wiki/display/Heritrix/Heritrix),
and [WGet](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). I would be particularly
interested in which tools make sense in small, medium and large cultural
heritage organizations (Libraries, Archives, Museums, Historical
Societies) and in consideration of use of standards, preservation risks,
ease of use, differences in approaches to significant properties and
sustainability.

Unfortunately, I had lots of difficulties using all of them.

There could be 2 distinct goals:

-   preserve few sites as well as possible
-   preserve a lot of sites with "best effort" quality.

For the first option, you'd better have an array of these tools, plus a
couple of paid ones, and try all of them to select the one that provides
the best quality on this particular website.

For the second goal, I'd go with wget because it's easiest to script.
Maybe also HTTrack, but wget is simpler and probably easier to build a
crawling cluster from.

In the medium-sized archives where I used to work, we used web httrack
for a couple reasons:

1- it was free, and since web harvesting for preservation was not a
regular part of our acquisition policy it didn't make sense to pay for
any service

2- it was very simple to run in the browser and the parameters/settings
were well-documented online

We did run into problems using it, though. We could only crawl the site
we were capturing every 2 days because the process took so long (I
assume because of the size of the site and the limitations of our
processors, which at that stage were limited to a test machine). When
the crawl finished, sometimes the CSS had changed during the course of
the processing, so we had to go back and manually update it for some
parts of the site -- a very tedious process.

It may well be worth looking at [WAIL](http://matkelly.com/wail/), which
attempts to bundle up Heritix and Wayback to make then easier to use.
Making the 'big' tools like Heritrix more usable by more people is a
great idea.
