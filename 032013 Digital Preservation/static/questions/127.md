What are some good clipboard-archiving utilities for archiving everything I copy in Windows?
=====================
I use ClipCache right now and it has a \>1 GB file, but it does have
some flaws (Snipping Tool and Excel captures take up an unreasonably
huge amount of space) so I am looking into alternatives.

* wizzard0: For the guys voting to close - could anybody explain? While this
question is certainly not as proudly-looking as "archiving the internet"
but it is certainly related to DP, has a definite answer and is useful
to many people.
