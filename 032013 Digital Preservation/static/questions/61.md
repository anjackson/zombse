How to store CD discs to preserve the data longer?
=====================
How (and where) to store CD discs to assure that the data stored there
would be readable as long as possible?

Are the room temperature and humidity optimal, or it would be better to
store them in colder place? Cellars are usually much colder, but they
have often high humidity.

Additionally, how they should be stored? Is wrapping them in paper a
good idea? Or better are textile materials such as cotton?
