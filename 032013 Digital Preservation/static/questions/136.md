What is the easiest way to archive a rapidly-updating website every 5 minutes?
=====================
Say, an Ajax-heavy website like my Facebook news feed or my Quora news
feed updates itself every 5 minutes or so, and I want to be able to
automatically store "snapshots" of the refreshes every 5 minutes or so.
How would I go about doing it?

Quora provides an RSS feed. This is what you should archive. It is a
friendly XML format. As for Facebook, sorry, I cannot help you there.
