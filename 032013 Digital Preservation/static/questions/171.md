What are the benefits of certifying a repository as a "Trusted Digital Repository" (ISO 16363)
=====================
We are looking at what it takes to become a trusted digital repository
(TDR)

I have gone through the ISO standard and there is a lot of work and
money to gain this certification

So I have a couple of questions

1.  is it worthwhile doing the certification - some institutions who
    have failed the test have indicated that it is of no value - not
    sure if this is a case of 'sour grapes'

2.  if we were certified would other institutions be willing to place
    their archives into the TDR

Your collective thoughts would be much appreciated

* Paul Wheatley: The title of the question is not a question. Can we get an edit to make
it more meaningful please? Perhaps something along the lines of: "What
are the benefits of certifying a digital repository?" The 2nd
sub-question is asking for speculation, so perhaps needs a re-write?
* Paul Wheatley: Looks like I'm wrong on the 2nd sub question as we've got some excellent
answers below. The title still desperately needs a re-write though.

The digital archive certification world a little messy right now. There
are multiple acronyms (TRAC, TDR, OAIS) and ISO standards (14721, 16363,
16919) and they have very similar of names.

At this moment, no auditing body is certified to certify a repository as
a TDR, also known as [ISO
16363](http://www.iso16363.org/news/iso-16363-2012-now-published-on-iso-site-as-international-standard/).
First, we need to establish a standard for certifying the auditors. This
is in draft form as [ISO
16919](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57950).
The current roadblock is that the standard needs to define the
distribution of auditor certifying organizations. National? Regional?
Supranational? It's still in debate.

In the meantime, we have the provisional auditing scheme based on
OAIS/ISO 14721 known as
[TRAC](http://www.crl.edu/archiving-preservation/digital-archives/metrics-assessing-and-certifying)
that served as the basis for TDR/ISO 16363. Only the Center for Research
Libraries (CRL) is certified to use TRAC. As far as I understand, CRL is
auditing repositories using TDR/ISO 16363 since the standard has been
accepted but assigning a TRAC label to them since they are not certified
to give TDR certifications.

​1) Is certification worth it? I would say it depends on the size of the
institution. It is expensive, but having a third-party evaluate the
current preservation capability of a system is essential. Certification
should measure the current effectiveness of administrative, technical,
and staff capabilities in a more objective manner. As organizations grow
in size and budget, it becomes more difficult to keep an objective view
of all of these factors. If you work through the self-auditing versions
of TRAC and [TDR/ISO
16363](http://www.iso16363.org/assets/Self-AssessmentTemplateforISO16363.xls),
you'll see that's it's an [immense amount of
work](http://www.iso16363.org/preparing-for-an-audit/) and very
difficult to remain objective with every metric.

​2) Would you like to position your archive as a digital repository for
institutions that lack the infrastructure?
[Chronopolis](http://chronopolis.sdsc.edu/) certainly does this for
research data, and it uses it's TRAC certification as a seal of approval
(it's the first link in their menu structure). However, I think
certification itself will not automatically attract clients. It's most
effective as a feature to distinguish one repository from another.

I'm skeptical that a full-blown certification regime will ever get much
traction because it's expensive, and more importantly, it's unclear that
becoming certified provides much in the way of return.

The original idea behind TDR a decade ago was that data users would want
hard proof that repositories were doing the right thing. Speculation was
that, absent such proof, repositories would fall short of their mission
to support research. Is there current evidence for this hypothesis? Are
users really that worried about what repositories are doing? Are
institutions reluctant to transfer data on this basis? Sure,
certification is a plus, but how much of one? If it really conveyed a
major advantage, wouldn't the process have moved ahead faster over the
last 10 years?

There is a need for model guidance on developing and improving
repository practices, and there are some good candidates for this
purpose. The Data Seal of Approval, created by the [Data Archiving and
Networked Services](http://datasealofapproval.org/?q=node/12) (DANS)
archive in The Netherlands is one (site is currently down, ironically).
The "seal of approval" is granted after a repository runs through a
self-assessment of 16 basic guidelines. The process is much less
intensive (and expensive) than TDR certification. And it does grant
third-party approval in cases where that's needed.

Another potential source of model guidance is simpler still: the [Levels
of Digital
Preservation](http://blogs.loc.gov/digitalpreservation/2012/11/ndsa-levels-of-digital-preservation-release-candidate-one/)
developed collaboratively through the National Digital Stewardship
Alliance. This guidance (still in beta) offers four levels of activity,
from basic to advanced, for major preservation functions, such as
storage and geographic location, file fixity and file formats. This
isn't the be all and end all, but it provides an excellent way for an
institution to assess it's practices and chart a path toward
improvement.

Efforts such as these should be extended and improved with an eye to
helping institutions make cost-effective, risk-based decisions about
digital preservation practices.

A few weeks ago a [message](http://www.ocul.on.ca/node/1637) on the
[DIGITAL-PRESERVATION@JISCMAIL.AC.UK](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=digital-preservation)
list announced the TDR certification of Scholars Portal.

I've found their
[wiki](http://spotdocs.scholarsportal.info/display/OAIS/Home) extremely
useful and clear with a well documented audit progress. For example:

-   [Document
    Checklist](http://spotdocs.scholarsportal.info/display/OAIS/Document+Checklist)
-   [TRAC2 Progress
    Overview](http://spotdocs.scholarsportal.info/display/OAIS/TRAC2+Progress+Overview)

* Nick Krabbenhoeft: You'll notice that although they claim TDR status, they were certified
with TRAC. "The audit measured Scholars Portal’s compliance with
established criteria for trusted digital repositories, including the
Trustworthy Repositories Audit & Certification: Criteria and Checklist
(TRAC)"
* Steve M: This is in part due to not wanting to list the full list of evaluative
criteria on a simple press release. =) For more clarity on this, see
page 3 of the audit report.

Source: I am the digital preservation contact for an archive that was
recently certified as a TDR (Scholars Portal).
([http://www.ocul.on.ca/node/1639](http://www.ocul.on.ca/node/1639))

In response to your preamble saying it's time intensive and expensive:
It's definitely time- and resource- intensive to do a proper evaluation
by TRAC/ISO16363. That said, so is the process of digital preservation.
The standards can be used in a couple of ways: to improve your existing
processes if you think they are not robust in their support for
long-term preservation, or to demonstrate to others that you are doing a
good job of these tasks if you are. The amount of resources you'll want
to put into either of those tasks is proportionate to the importance of
digital preservation in your organization's mission.

The argument that complying with TRAC/ISO 16363 is expensive seems a bit
specious to me. Is it expensive to go through the full audit and be
certified by an outside agency? It can be, but at the same time if your
community or organization needs assurance, then outside certification
can be an effective way to show that. Look at the organiztions who have
undergone the formal audit: Portico, HathiTrust, Chronopolis, Scholars
Portal. Without exception, these are organizations who accept money
(sometimes in the form of subscription fees, sometimes in the form of
regular funding) to "do digital preservation". Those who are paying the
money likely want some assurance it's being done correctly.

So, in answer to your questions:

​1) I'd say, if you need to prove to somebody that you're doing a good
job of digital preservation (say because they give you money), this is a
good way to do it. If you're looking for a way to evaluate your own
processes, then I think the standard still has a lot of value as a tool
for guided self-reflection. You can also look at other self-evaluation
tools like the Data Seal of Approval
([http://datasealofapproval.org/](http://datasealofapproval.org/)). Note
that functionally, the DSA and TRAC are basically the same. I happen to
like the TRAC way of breaking down the evidence a little better because
it's a bit more granular. That structure is what enabled us to create
the wiki where we posted all of our evidence from our TRAC audit
([http://spotdocs.scholarsportal.info/display/OAIS/Home](http://spotdocs.scholarsportal.info/display/OAIS/Home)).

I'm also of the opinion that being able to post a point-by-point
dissection of our preservation operations in an organized and cogent way
is at least as useful as the formal certification because it lets anyone
who cares see exactly what we're doing. So, in this regard, the time
spent preparing for the audit was doubly useful in establishing trust.

​2) No, I don't even know who you are. Any kind of validation, whether
it's TRAC/ISO16363/DSA-based, and whether it's self- or external
auditing is only useful to validate your processes as they fill the
needs of your user community (Designated Community in OAIS parlance).
TDR certification is not some kind of magic bullet that is going to make
you a heavy hitter in preservation overnight. In fact, a number of the
audit points depend on having a demonstrated history of service and
successful preservation.

TLDR; If you're just starting out in digital preservation, TDR
certification is probably not worth it, but the standard (and others
like it) are useful tools to ensure you're developing services in a
sound way. If you're already doing preservation and want to demonstrate
to the outside world that you're doing a good job, certification can be
one way to do that. So can plain old openness.

In any case, certification isn't a magic bullet to all of a sudden make
you a great repository. It's all about reinforcing the trust that your
community has in you and becoming more accountable. Whether that fits
into your business case is up to you.

* Nicholas Webb: Re: using TRAC/TDR for "guided self-reflection," I used ISO 16363 to
define and formalize procedures in the small repository I administer.
Even though certification isn't on our immediate agenda, I found it to
be an exceptionally useful tool for uncovering gaps in our workflow and
documentation and for ensuring thorough coverage. Evaluating our
practices with reference to an ISO standard is also helpful in
demonstrating to departmental superiors what it is that our repository
does and how it differs from other IT functions.

I work for the University of Michigan Library on HathiTrust, and I know
that TRAC certification was indeed a lot of work for my colleagues
involved in the process. The following is a quote from HathiTrust's
press release in March of 2011 announcing TRAC certification.

> Certification represents a major achievement for the partnership,
> which has defined itself by the transparency of its operations, the

The above doesn't provide a deep answer to the questions posed, but it
provides a little insight into the value HathiTrust places on
certification. The following are links that might be useful to
organizations considering certification because they show the scope of
the questions, and quality of the answers.
