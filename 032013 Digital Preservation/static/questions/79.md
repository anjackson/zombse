How do I backup and restore a Game Boy cartridge save file?
=====================
The internal battery in Game Boy cartridges eventually depletes, which
erases its temporary contents (the game progress saved in RAM). How can
I backup and restore this game save (e.g., the original *Pok√©mon*)
between battery replacements or as a precaution against the effects of
time?

* wizzard0: I believe the overlap between archivists and gamers is rather small; you
might consider sharing this question on forums where people are
emulating consoles - they usually know how to read and write cartridges
and firmware, both ROM and RAM.
* Trevor Owens: I think this is a great question for this site and there is a good group
of folks in digital preservation who want to get into video game
preservation. See also:

* Bill Lefurgy: Agree that this is a good question for the site. We need a central body
of information on migrating data.

----------------
There is an Arduino-based tutorial for reading the ROM and RAM from the
GameBoy cartridge:
[http://www.insidegadgets.com/2011/03/28/gbcartread-arduino-based-gameboy-cart-reader-%E2%80%93-part-2-read-the-ram/](http://www.insidegadgets.com/2011/03/28/gbcartread-arduino-based-gameboy-cart-reader-%E2%80%93-part-2-read-the-ram/)

And for writing back to RAM:
[http://www.insidegadgets.com/2011/04/07/gbcartread-arduino-based-gameboy-cart-reader-%e2%80%93-part-3-write-to-ram](http://www.insidegadgets.com/2011/04/07/gbcartread-arduino-based-gameboy-cart-reader-%e2%80%93-part-3-write-to-ram)

Or you can switch to playing the games in an emulator.
