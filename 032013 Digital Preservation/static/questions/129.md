How can I digitize as many of my old notebooks with as little extra effort as possible?
=====================
I have a very large number of notebooks by now, and they're a pain to
lug around (especially since I have to move around a lot). Is there a
way for me to mass digitize them without having to do anything manually
at all?

There are book-scanning services like
[http://www.blueleaf-book-scanning.com/](http://www.blueleaf-book-scanning.com/),
but they don't seem to accept notebooks yet.
