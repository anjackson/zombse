The font is typewriter-like, which does not work well with OCR. We own the publishing rights, and have experimented with tearing apart individual volumes to feed through a sheet-fed scanner. The results are good for creating an image PDF but not for text. As you can imagine, an OCR error which changes a marriage date from 1868 to 1888 is significant, and unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a simple matter to strip a book and create a book on CD as our books go out of print. However, moving forward into the 21st century, we would like to convert the information to digital form (a standard genealogy database). After three years of trying to figure something out, our only solution is to type the thousands of pages from scratch into our genealogy database.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing which makes OCR particularly difficult is that the tails of letters tend to be faint. That is, the bottom of the &quot;g&quot; in &quot;Strong&quot; is OCR'd as a &quot;q&quot;. Since this is the Strong family genealogy, that's a problem! I can search and replace, but again the error rate remains too high. With a typewriter font, my OCR program &quot;cleans&quot; nearly all punctuation out, so no periods or semicolons remain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We'd be grateful for any suggestions in converting our print books to database form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16" LastActivityDate="2013-02-27T14:22:17.353" Title="Converting our printed genealogies into digital form" Tags="&lt;ocr&gt;&lt;digitize&gt;&lt;genealogy&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="2" FavoriteCount="0" />

Solutions a and c are the slowest, b and d the fastest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when an organization is considering a conversion project, they first have to figure out the quality, budget and schedule constraints that they are working under. Then they have to determine if there are any special factors, such as proprietary material that you don't really want to have to ship out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are really too many possible scenarios to give any hard and fast rules as to whether it's better to do it in-house or contract.

Normal storage, like USB and external hard drives, are probably good enough.  Any of a number of on online storage services would also fit the bill here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is it 10 years?  You'd need something that doesn't degrade over time, so magnetic media could be out of the question.  Although there's stories of people firing up 8&quot; drives and getting data off from old floppies, I wouldn't count on that.  Something like storing your data on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mdisc.com&quot;&gt;M-Disc from Milleniatta&lt;/a&gt;, along with at least two or three DVD drives should be enough.  USB seems to have staying power (and backward compatibility up to now), so you should be able to find a USB drive somewhere to connect it to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is it 50 years?  Now it gets interesting.  Think about this.  50 years ago, computers were only used by the government or big corporations.  So, what will 50 more years do to computing?  What we now know as &quot;computers&quot; might actually be invisible and wireless, so you'd have nothing to &quot;read&quot; your data with.  Electricity should still be available (assuming no nuclear winter, asteroid hitting earth, etc), so maybe saving all your data on something like the M-Disc mentioned above, plus a fully functional laptop computer, with all the applications/drivers needed to read the data AND full instructions on how to use it (fifty years into the future, it might not be yourself that's reading the data), including electricity/voltage specs.  At least you'll be able to read the data, even if you can't find a 50-year old computer by then (have you seen an old UNIVAC lying around these days?  Yeah, didn't think so).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is it 100+ years?  At this point, honestly, I wouldn't trust any company's claim of &quot;eternal&quot;, &quot;permanent&quot;, etc.  Also, I wouldn't trust there being electricity at all.  From the archival/historical point of view, the only things that have withstood the test of time are well-cared-for papyrus/books, and carved rock (think the Rosetta Stone).  You could think about printing all your data in binary format in archival-quality paper, and storing all that in an airtight container. Think big QR codes with lots of redundancy/error correction built in, and/or hex values.  You'd have to make sure the printer/ink you use is permanent, doesn't fade, and doesn't get &quot;sticky&quot; over time.  Make sure you include a plain-english (maybe even multiple languages) document specifying how to decode the QR codes if you go this way, and a basic explanation of hex numbers.  A &quot;primer&quot; if you will.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is it 1000+ years?  Only carved rock has withstood thousands of years in the past.  Even huge metal monuments have been melted down for ammunition and weapons, or stolen, while carved rock is usually left alone during times of hardship.  You'd probably have to go with granite or maybe even pure quartz, along with a computer-driven laser and sandblaster.

Larger organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://documents.el-una.org/923/1/ELUNA_2012_Presentation_Final_2012_5_7.pdf&quot;&gt;LDS&lt;/a&gt; can afford a large tape array, while smaller organizations can get away with a cloud service &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backblaze.com/&quot;&gt;Backblaze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crashplan.com&quot;&gt;Crashplan&lt;/a&gt;.

It is an extremely simple format (basically a header specifying color depth, width, height and some identifying information, followed by the raw pixel data), and it supports up to eight bits per pixel per channel in three channels (red, green and blue) which is the same as PNG and JPEG. From what I understand, any BMP using less than 256 distinct colors also stores the color palette used, but for photos, it makes sense to use 24 bits per pixel to capture as much color fidelity as possible. The remainder of this answer deals primarily with 24-bpp BMPs, but the general principles should hold at any bit depth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The lack of compression means the files are very large (a 15 Mpx photo in 24-bit color will be nearly 50 MB in size), but also makes them &lt;em&gt;easy to interpret&lt;/em&gt; if only you have cursory knowledge of the format. About all you need to know is that there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Bitmap_file_header&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a relatively small header&lt;/a&gt; followed by RGB byte triplets each specifying one pixel (or an appropriate number of bytes per pixel specifying indexes into the palette), and you can probably write a decoder by simple trial and error in a few hours. Given a set of uncompressed BMP files and preferably &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; clue what they are supposed to look like, implementing a BMP viewer from scratch is a fairly trivial task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another upside of uncompressed BMP is that minor data loss (other than in the header) leads to absolutely minimal degradation: only the exact pixels actually affected by the data loss are corrupted. And with some mathematical trickery and human trial-and-error, the header can probably be reconstructed from an otherwise complete image file, even if the image data itself is degraded or corrupted, as long as the number of bytes is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The major downside of BMP is that the files are huge. For a full-color image of any substantial pixel size, the resulting file size in bytes can be approximated as &lt;code&gt;3 * H * W&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;H&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; are the height and width in pixels, respectively. As we know, image size expressed in megapixels is simply &lt;code&gt;H * W&lt;/code&gt;, so for a given image size of &lt;code&gt;Mp megapixels&lt;/code&gt; this simply reduces to &lt;code&gt;3 * Mp&lt;/code&gt; megabytes of image data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BMPs can also store ICC color profiles, enabling the viewer to accurately render the colors as intended. That would be more complex to implement, and I'm not sure how widespread support for ICC-carrying BMPs is even today, but also would allow more faithful visualization of the data than is possible with simply RGB triplets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much any other format which meets the requirement of being easy to read and long-lived in the face of advancing technology, compression algorithms and so on, is going to basically boil down to the same thing (a container plus raw, uncompressed bitmap data representing pixel color value triplets). Uncompressed TIFF for example falls into that category. So unless you have specific needs which cannot be met using BMP you would gain little by choosing such a more advanced format, and risk making it more difficult to understand for someone who has to reverse-engineer it. Better then to stick to the KISS principle: &lt;em&gt;keep it simple, stupid&lt;/em&gt;. For preservation purposes, I'd take a stack of BMPs over a single multi-page uncompressed TIFF any day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2013-02-27T18:53:27.187" LastActivityDate="2013-02-27T18:53:27.187" CommentCount="4" />

In the early years of 3.5&quot; floppies there were &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3.5%22_Floppy_Disk#3+1.E2.81.842-inch_floppy_disk_.28.22Microfloppy.22.29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a number of different physical formats&lt;/a&gt; (400kb, 800kb, single- and double-density, etc.), and not all drives were compatible with all types. A lot of the &quot;toaster&quot;-style Macs could only read certain varieties -- I remember this giving me headaches even at the time. If you think you might have disks in these formats, you should make sure that they are supported by whichever drive you end up using.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've created the disk images, you can open and mount them in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_computer_system_emulators#Apple_Macintosh_with_680x0_CPU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;emulator&lt;/a&gt;. I can't recommend a particular emulator for an SE, but I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheepShaver&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;SheepShaver&lt;/a&gt; to access disks created by a circa-1997 PowerTower (one of the short-lived Macintosh clones running System 7.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Setup will depend on the particular emulator you're using, but you should be aware that  pre-X versions of Mac OS, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/System/Older_System/System_6.0.x/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;System 6&lt;/a&gt;, are available for free from Apple's website. If you still have the installation disks for the software your parents used, you can take images of those and use them to install the necessary applications in the emulation environment without having to delve into the legal gray area of abandonware.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Migrating your data to a contemporary format will depend on the particular applications and might be difficult. At the cost of losing some of the formatting, you might be able to export the data into an open format (ASCII text for word processing documents, CSV for spreadsheets) that you could then open on your current system. Ideally the application itself will be able to do this, but you might have to dig around to find a file conversion utility that runs on System 6.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you've done all this, you can manage the disk images like you would any other files in your personal organization/backup system. If you plan to preserve this collection long-term (or to eventually store it in a formal repository), you should record any provenance/identifying information so that you know the contents and extent of what you have. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't need to be complicated -- human-readable filenames and a spreadsheet are fine -- but you should be able to identify which images came from which (physical) disks and what each image contains, even if you end up discarding the physical copies. (I.e., image &quot;Financial_2.img&quot; came from an 800kb Maxell floppy with a handwritten label &quot;Financial Records Disk 2 of 6&quot; and contains financial data for the year 1988 in ClarisWorks Spreadsheet format.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, you might want to keep a record of how to configure and set up the emulator, what the contemporary OS and hardware requirements are to run the emulator, what software (running on the emulator) is necessary to access the files, et cetera. That way, if you pass the collection on to someone else, or if you don't use it for several years and forget exactly what you did, you'll have the Representation Information (in OAIS terms) necessary to keep your data accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, I used this process to back up and preserve the contents of a System 7 desktop. Accessing the files is as easy as booting SheepShaver and mounting the disk image, although I haven't tackled the process of exporting them to preservation formats yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2013-03-01T13:52:02.863" LastActivityDate="2013-03-01T13:52:02.863" CommentCount="1" />

There are many hierarchies which are only available in certain regions or to users of certain ISPs (or Usenet server providers), and there are hierarchies which are generally excluded from archiving (&lt;code&gt;alt.binaries.*&lt;/code&gt; comes to mind). Also, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a publicly available archive that goes back a significant amount of time. DejaNews, which got bought by Google, had a quite good archive, and I do believe that Google is allowing access to all of it, but last I heard it wasn't really searchable in a practical way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol, the protocol that Usenet clients and servers use to talk to each other) is largely a best-effort protocol. Not all news posts are guaranteed to be on every server (though usually they do end up that way eventually), and they are not guaranteed to be delivered to each server in the order of their creation. Different posts may be delivered through entirely different servers. This is all a product of NNTP's initial design, where it had to run over such arcane transport protocols as UUCP as well as TCP/IP (and many others; &quot;everyone&quot; running TCP/IP is a relatively new invention, and now we are moving into a mixed protocol world again as we head into a combined IPv4/IPv6 Internet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't know exactly how the process would go for getting a new newsgroup into the major archives. That would probably depend on their configuration, which is a factor you don't control. You could contact the administrators and ask for your group to be included if it doesn't show up in their archives, but that's about it as far as control over what is archived goes. The posts to be archived would still have to make it to them, however and obviously, and they would almost certainly only archive content from the point in time of inclusion of the newsgroup into their archive. I don't see one Usenet archive(r/provider) going out of their way to track down copies of previous posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Access for regular users is limited. While there are both free and fee-based Usenet servers available to the general public, and software is available for the taking, very few people these days are likely to install and configure a NNTP client.

More specifically, TIFF with 24 bits of RGB color or 8 bits grayscale for black and white images, without compression. It has proprietary origins but is open and probably more widely adopted than any other format making it a de-facto standard. Like most formats, there are many varieties of TIFF. TIFF without compression is most appropriate. TIFF is rarely used with LZW lossless compression within the preservation community, because &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch&quot;&gt;LZW&lt;/a&gt; has multiple commercially held patents associated with it, making it undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000153.shtml&quot;&gt;PNG&lt;/a&gt; is a viable preservation format that supports lossless compression that is free of patents (unlike LZW). If TIFF had not come first, PNG might be used more widely for preservation than it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;JPEG does not comply because is uses lossy compression. Every time a lossy compression is resaved, the visual artifacts of the lossy compression are compounded and the quality of the image degrades. Some software applications, such as iPhoto, mitigate the effects by keeping the original so the option always exists to revert to it. Technically, the JPEG format supports lossless compression as well, but this feature is so rarely implemented in software that it cannot be depended on in the preservation context. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;JPEG2000 complies if used with only lossless compression (a.k.a. reversible), though it is relatively a very complicated format. It is used extensively by some large preservation repositories, but is not a good choice for the average user. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RAW formats tend to be proprietary and therefore not as reliable in the long term.  RAW formats store the greatest amount of visual data because it represents what the hardware is actually capable of, but are not supported widely by viewing applications. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Negative&quot;&gt;Adobe Digital Negative&lt;/a&gt; (DNG) is, however, a relatively good option in this realm.

While Mac high-density (1.4MB) disks will be easily readable and at least imageable if you have a USB floppy drive and software like dd or FTK Imager, you will not be able to image 400K (single-sided double density) or 800K (double-sided double density) disks using this setup. The reason behind this is the encoding scheme used on the disk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High-density floppies use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Frequency_Modulation&quot;&gt;MFM&lt;/a&gt; encoding, which is supported by essentially all contemporary floppy controller boards (including those found in USB floppies, and those found on some recent motherboards). Double density Mac floppies, however, use &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Code_Recording&quot;&gt;GCR&lt;/a&gt; encoding, which is &lt;strong&gt;unsupported by most recent controllers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To image GCR-encoded floppies using a more recent computer, you will need a board such as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kryoflux.com/&quot;&gt;KryoFlux&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Computers_Catweasel&quot;&gt;Catweasel&lt;/a&gt;.

If you're imaging 400K SSDD Mac disks, these disks will probably contain an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_File_System&quot;&gt;MFS&lt;/a&gt; file system, which very few contemporary tools will read. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System&quot;&gt;HFS&lt;/a&gt; and HFS+/HFS Extended file systems are somewhat easier to read using recent tools - FTK Imager, for instance, will support reading and extracting those images.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="126" LastActivityDate="2013-03-01T03:40:27.557" CommentCount="1" />

I realize at this point that it's likely to be a bit of both for any institution that is truly beginning on acquiring assets off media.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At an absolute minimum, I would recommend a USB write blocker such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiebetech.com/products/USB-WriteBlocker.php&quot;&gt;WiebeTech inline writeblocker&lt;/a&gt; (199 USD) or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tableau.com/index.php?pageid=products&amp;amp;model=T8-R2&quot;&gt;Tableau T8-R2&lt;/a&gt; (~299 USD). While it's possible that acquisitions may come in as bare hard drives or drives pulled from existing machines, these can often be easily attached to USB enclosures. Most USB write blockers will work with the majority of USB mass storage devices, which allows for the most flexibility - for example, you can attach USB flash drives, a USB flash card reader, or USB Zip drives to a write blocker. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also strongly recommend investing in some reasonably decent optical drives to acquire CD-ROM/CD-R/DVD images. A tray-loading drive rather than a slot-loading drive is preferable given the existence of smaller size (3&quot; and &quot;business card&quot;) CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend having a reasonably good amount (8 TB+, depending on how much you expect to acquire) of online, local staging storage. At my place of employment, we've used a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drobo.com/products/business/b800fs/index.php&quot;&gt;Drobo B800fs&lt;/a&gt; for this, and with 8 X 2 TB drives, we have approximately 12 TB of usable staging storage. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For acquisition alone, you don't really need a high-powered machine. In fact, our acquisition machines are relatively have relatively low specs (AMD Phenom IIx4 970 3.5 GHz processor, 4 GB RAM). Alternately, I'd suggest consider acquiring (in addition, if resources allow) a high-powered laptop to make field-based acquisitions go much easier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you expect to do a reasonable amount of processing of acquired assets, you'll definitely want a higher-powered workstation, however, but in our case it was cheaper not to buy a FRED and instead to buy a high-end Dell workstation and add 48 GB of RAM. The specs for such a machine largely depend on the type of processing you'll be doing, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any drives for obsolete or uncommon formats should be treated as extras, in my opinion. While it might make sense to have a setup with floppy drives, you should consider whether these media are worth the time and effort to set up a local means to read them. This is equally true of formats like Jaz cartridges, Syquest cartridges, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of useful accessories, I've mentioned them in line - things like cables, adapters, card readers, etc. are all inexpensive and easily sourced from your favorite online computer retailer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="126" LastEditorUserId="126" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2013-03-01T04:25:47.347" LastActivityDate="2013-03-01T04:25:47.347" />

The data will also be protected by the Fedora security layer; for instance delete may be forbidden by FeSL policies.

On Unix and Unix-like systems, this is usually achieved using the &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; tool which ships with the OS, although other options do exist; on Windows, separate imaging tools are normally needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barring such difficulties as inter-sector copy protection measures (which I believe were used to some extent at one point, although I don't know if they were employed on the Macintosh), this gives you a copy of all the data on the media that the original operating system would be able to access. Boot sector, file system metadata, recorded-as-unused blocks, everything gets copied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on one's needs, knowledge of the file system used could then be used to extract files and folders from the media image if that is sufficient for preservation. If you are trying to preserve the &lt;em&gt;payload data&lt;/em&gt; rather than the exact data and metadata structures on the disk, and if it can be done either losslessly or with acceptable losses, it makes sense to not just image the disks but also transform the data into a more accessible format. The raw disk images could still be retained, but used for secondary access should any specific need arise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;2) Is this image format I will be dumping for use purposes also sufficient for long term preservation? Should I also be dumping a format that preserves lower level information?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In almost all cases (see caveat about copy protection above), I don't see any real use for any lower level information than what can be obtained by making a byte-by-byte read and copy of the media. You would then be looking at specialized tools to read (assuming magnetic media such as floppies; optical media such as CDs would be different, and solid-state media would be a whole different ballgame) the magnetic flux variations in the physical space &lt;em&gt;between&lt;/em&gt; sectors. Such reads &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;, in principle and when properly analyzed, reveal traces of previously overwritten data, but they could just as well simply indicate drive read/write head misalignment. No two floppy disk drives have read/write heads which are &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; aligned with each other other than by pure chance, so some variance in the physical location of the written data is to be expected. Normally the read head(s) simply detect whatever signal happens to be strongest, since the difference between the desired and old signals will be orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hard part about copying old Apple media in particular, such as old Macintosh or Apple II/III floppy disks, is that depending on the media size, &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalpreservation.stackexchange.com/a/139/97&quot;&gt;some of them use GCR encoding&lt;/a&gt; rather than the MFM encoding which eventually replaced it. Sourcing a working floppy disk drive today which can read GCR &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; can interface with modern hardware might be difficult, so a multi-stage approach might be needed: first transfer a binary image of the media onto a system which can natively read GCR floppies, then transfer that image by some other means onto a more modern system for further use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="97" LastEditorUserId="97" LastEditorDisplayName="" LastEditDate="2013-03-01T22:48:56.263" LastActivityDate="2013-03-01T22:48:56.263" />

I would say it depends on the size of the institution. It is expensive, but having a third-party evaluate the current preservation capability of a system is essential. Certification should measure the current effectiveness of administrative, technical, and staff capabilities in a more objective manner. As organizations grow in size and budget, it becomes more difficult to keep an objective view of all of these factors.

Are users really that worried about what repositories are doing? Are  institutions reluctant to transfer data on this basis? Sure, certification is a plus, but how much of one?

While some companies have gone out of business, the IP usually still belongs to somebody out there, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might also ask yourself, if it's worth it to actually keep old software around in a runnable state.  Why would you want to run WordStar 4.0 these days, for example?  Maybe if you're really nostalgic about old word processors, but otherwise, probably only of interest to a computer museum.  Any data that could have been useful in those old platforms and/or applications has probably already been migrated to newer platforms, so there is no need to keep the old software around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="57" LastActivityDate="2013-03-03T11:11:43.037" />

That said, so is the process of digital preservation. The standards can be used in a couple of ways: to improve your existing processes if you think they are not robust in their support for long-term preservation, or to demonstrate to others that you are doing a good job of these tasks if you are. The amount of resources you'll want to put into either of those tasks is proportionate to the importance of digital preservation in your organization's mission. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The argument that complying with TRAC/ISO 16363 is expensive seems a bit specious to me. Is it expensive to go through the full audit and be certified by an outside agency? It can be, but at the same time if your community or organization needs assurance, then outside certification can be an effective way to show that. Look at the organiztions who have undergone the formal audit: Portico, HathiTrust, Chronopolis, Scholars Portal. Without exception, these are organizations who accept money (sometimes in the form of subscription fees, sometimes in the form of regular funding) to &quot;do digital preservation&quot;. Those who are paying the money likely want some assurance it's being done correctly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in answer to your questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;1) I'd say, if you need to prove to somebody that you're doing a good job of digital preservation (say because they give you money), this is a good way to do it. If you're looking for a way to evaluate your own processes, then I think the standard still has a lot of value as a tool for guided self-reflection. You can also look at other self-evaluation tools like the Data Seal of Approval (&lt;a href=&quot;http://datasealofapproval.org/&quot;&gt;http://datasealofapproval.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Note that functionally, the DSA and TRAC are basically the same. I happen to like the TRAC way of breaking down the evidence a little better because it's a bit more granular. That structure is what enabled us to create the wiki where we posted all of our evidence from our TRAC audit (&lt;a href=&quot;http://spotdocs.scholarsportal.info/display/OAIS/Home&quot;&gt;http://spotdocs.scholarsportal.info/display/OAIS/Home&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also of the opinion that being able to post a point-by-point dissection of our preservation operations in an organized and cogent way is at least as useful as the formal certification because it lets anyone who cares see exactly what we're doing. So, in this regard, the time spent preparing for the audit was doubly useful in establishing trust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) No, I don't even know who you are. Any kind of validation, whether it's TRAC/ISO16363/DSA-based, and whether it's self- or external auditing is only useful to validate your processes as they fill the needs of your user community (Designated Community in OAIS parlance). TDR certification is not some kind of magic bullet that is going to make you a heavy hitter in preservation overnight. In fact, a number of the audit points depend on having a demonstrated history of service and successful preservation. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TLDR; If you're just starting out in digital preservation, TDR certification is probably not worth it, but the standard (and others like it) are useful tools to ensure you're developing services in a sound way. If you're already doing preservation and want to demonstrate to the outside world that you're doing a good job, certification can be one way to do that. So can plain old openness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case, certification isn't a magic bullet to all of a sudden make you a great repository. It's all about reinforcing the trust that your community has in you and becoming more accountable.

This might be particularly handy if your institution is not normally in the business of handling sensitive materials and the difficult process of retrofitting strong access controls throughout the system is too challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is one interesting technical aspect, however, which is worth reviewing: encryption requires you to treat the keys as rigorously as the actual archived material but the keys are considerably smaller which allows you to do things which would otherwise not be feasible given the size or sensitivity of the material. This could include using third-party services to transfer content and exchanging the keys over a separate channel, storing encrypted backups on a cloud provider or entering into a long-term partnership with a peer institution with the plan to release the keys later when the material leaves copyright or a donor restriction has expired. One particularly interesting aspect in some cases is that it may be possible to meet requirements for deleting content (horrible, I know, but in some cases it's necessary) by deleting the keys rather than having to prove that you've purged every copy of the data from your servers, backups, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One practical implication: each item (however you defined that logically) should be encrypted with a separate, very strong key.

Let's say my collection is in the range of 100 TB. If I have a process running fixity checks on stored archival data continuously (because it's going to take a while to get through everything), this will produce a sizeable log of fixity check event data: file path, hash value, date/time, outcome, etc. Storing this data for every fixity event in a PREMIS XML file seems inefficient and unwieldy (of course, storing the original hash value/algorithm/datetime created in PREMIS makes sense -- this is presumed to be the data that future fixity checks would validate against).  Likewise, I'm not sure if storing this data in a database is worthwhile either. It seems that text files with fixity event logs would be the more lightweight option.  My interrelated questions on this issue are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How do most repositories store fixity event outcome data? Log, data store, XML (PREMIS or other)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the outcome of the fixity check is positive, should I retain the data? Or should the system overwrite the old data when the process begins again? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the fixity outcome data is retained, for how many events, and for how long?  Should I only keep the data for the last 2 or 3 events, or keep them all indefinitely?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know some of this is a question of retention policy and specific to my repository's architecture, and that could be case by case for each repository, but I'm wondering what the general recommended practice is for retention and storage of this data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="142" LastActivityDate="2013-03-14T15:06:34.363" Title="What is the recommended practice for retaining logs of fixity checks?"

If this is an &quot;authored&quot; DVD, and not a data DVD, the video has already been encoded and compressed (using lossy compression) to a particular format: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2#DVD-Video&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MPEG-2&lt;/a&gt; with a colorspace of 4:2:0.

Optical media will be obsolete in just a few years and drives for these are already becoming scarce (my new MacBook Air doesn't have an optical drive!). Optical media also pose digital preservation management challenges as they are limited in how you can provide access, replicate, manage integrity, perform QC, etc.  As access copies for designated communities who want and prefer these formats, that's fine.

As digital preservation professionals, we have a responsibility to the public and other non-specialists to demystify this notion that there is something archival about optical discs that manufacturers seems to love to claim.

The section that covers &quot;Digital Source (media independent &quot;file based&quot;)&quot; video is dealing with what is also referred to as &quot;born-digital&quot; video.  These video files are born with specific characteristics, chroma subsampling being one of them. These characteristics should be considered significant properties of those files, for preservation purposes. Chroma subsampling refers to color compression, just as data rate refers to temporal compression.  When we talk about &quot;uncompressed&quot; video, we are usually talking about temporal compression.  When an archive chooses &quot;uncompressed&quot; as a target video spec for reformatting analog material, they often still have color compression, typically 4:2:2. We accept this degree of color sampling because &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the human eye is less sensitive to color than it is to luminance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But since you referenced born-digital, the issue is slightly different. For the vast majority of these files, the native chroma subsampling is 4:2:2, 4:1:1, or 4:2:0.  There are only a handful of cameras on the market today that are capable of producing 4:4:4 video, and those are generally high-end, professional digital cinema cameras. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in short answer to your question, if we only accept 4:4:4 files we will not be preserving 99%+ of the video content being produced today. And that is unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Digital video production and preservation has changed dramatically in the past 9 years since Jerry MacDonough wrote about 4:4:4 video.  At that time, digital (file based) preservation of video was very theoretical, and certainly not practical.  That's changed to the point where today it is the ONLY option for video preservation.  And costs have dropped to the point where it is feasible and realistic to create temporally uncompressed video. But generally speaking, there is no advantage to 4:4:4, and few systems that support its creation at this stage. That may change in the future, but for now, we are just not there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="142" LastActivityDate="2013-03-14T21:00:13.983" CommentCount="2" />
