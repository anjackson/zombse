  <row Id="271" PostId="234" Text="Thanks Andy – it's clear that such an image would capture the lowest level of information, but this says nothing of whether or not you would consider this to be a **preservation** format. This in my mind means not only a perfect capture of the data, but in a format that I will likely be able to interpret and render accurately in years to come."

I'm not aware of any other format that is capable of replaying DVD-specific features, e.g. menus etc." CreationDate="2013-03-13T04:15:48.120" UserId="31" />
  <row Id="273" PostId="234" Text="Agreed. If you want a 1:1 copy of the menus (VIDEO_TS) and all, image the disc; otherwise, defer to ffmpeg." CreationDate="2013-03-13T16:58:07.200" UserId="134" />
  <row Id="274" PostId="238" Text="Your points are well taken. Indeed the video I had in mind was, in post, ProRes 4:2:2 LT.&#xA;&#xA;I do think we possibly need to set aside the distinction between &quot;high-end, professional&quot; cameras and the rest of these. 4:4:4 appears at a glance to have about an, I dunno, $25,000 entry point at present time, but I expect this to drop. Vis, [here](http://wwsw.dslrnewsshooter.com/2012/12/29/a-late-christmas-gift-from-sound-devices-the-pix240-gets-free-4444-firmware-upgrade/), or the Red Camera, etc. I do not mean that all cameras are equal, but that high-end chroma schemes are becoming commonplace."

  <row Id="275" PostId="235" Text="If the hashes match, you certainly wouldn't need to store the hash again. A timestamp specifying when the most recent fixity check was performed could be beneficial, but for the expected hash, one can just go back to the ingest fixity data."

  <row Id="276" PostId="238" Score="1" Text="If you are preserving ProRes or Red, I would suggest you have bigger problems than chroma subsampling. Both are highly proprietary formats, completely controlled by vendors who could yank them from the market at any time. The manufacturer of the former has a tendency to do those sorts of planned obsolescence stunts (i.e. not supporting Flash on iphone/ipad). The latter is a manufacturer that requires you use their hardware and software to work with the files. And the company has a lot of competition these days. I would be more concerned about the sustainability of these formats." CreationDate="2013-03-16T04:20:49.723" UserId="142" />
  <row Id="277" PostId="85" Score="1" Text="Keep in mind that an audiovisual file is a complex digital object, with multiple &quot;formats&quot; to consider. There is the container format, then the encoding formats of the video, (optional) audio and other tracks. It is important to look files in their entirety when thinking about migration. While migration will likely have to occur frequently for access purposes, depending on your users needs, a high quality preservation master whose file and encoding formats score high on the Sustainability of Digital Formats criteria should have staying power."
